<h2>PREFACE</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> teaching of history in Constantinople naturally
leads to an interest in the history of Turkey, and also to
the recognition that little has been written on that subject
except on the side of political relations with Europe. One
who desires to present to western readers a brief study of
Turkish civilization might reasonably turn to the reign of
Suleiman the Magnificent, as being typical of the course of
Turkish history, and also as exhibiting Turkey at the
height of her powers. For the purpose of this dissertation,
the study has been confined to the career of Ibrahim Pasha,
grand vizir between 1522 and 1536.</p>

<p>The writer’s acknowledgments are due to Professors
Sloane and Gottheil for valuable criticism, and for their
aid in the obtaining of rare books, and to Professor and
Mrs. Robinson for the careful reading of proof.</p>

<h2>INTRODUCTION</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> life of Ibrahim Pasha, as full of strange events as
the most highly‐colored romance, paradoxical, and to western
students of society almost incomprehensible in its rapid
changes, is very difficult to place soberly before Occidental
readers; yet its very strangeness is typical of the Orient, and
if we could understand this romantic life we might find we
held a key to much in Turkish life and thought. But our
only chance of understanding it is to banish from our minds
western conceptions and accept as facts what seem like wild
imaginings. Ibrahim Pasha was not of the Turkish race,
a fact which accounts for some of the paradoxes of his
career, but his life was passed in a Turkish environment,
one of whose notable characteristics is that it has always at
once included and modified so many alien elements. In any
consideration of the Turkish people, the most important
thing to hold in mind is that the Turks are neither Aryan
nor Semitic, being unrelated to Persians, Arabs, Greeks, or
Hebrews. When ethnologists dare not speak definitely of
race distinctions, the layman cannot venture to place the
Turk in the “Touranian” or other group, but he can accept
the fact that the Turks came into Europe from Central
Asia and are in some way related to the Tatars and
Mongols in the East, and probably to the Magyars and
Finns in the West. The Turks of Central Asia during the
period from the eighth to the eleventh centuries seem to have
possessed qualities which characterize Turks of the period
we are studying, and even mark the Turk of the present
day.</p>

and the Mongols,<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">1</a> has made a careful study of these early
Turks, a portion of which I will briefly summarize here.</p>

<p>The dominating quality of the Turks of Central Asia
was their love of war. According to a Persian verse:
“They came and pillaged and burned and killed and charged
and vanished.” The one virtue required of them was obedience,
the only crime was treason. Activity to them meant
war: one word expressed the idea contained in our two
words <em>to run</em> and <em>to kill with the sword</em>. The ideal death
was in war; as their proverb ran, “Man is born in the house
but dies in the field.” In their earliest cults the worship of
steel and the sword are prominent.</p>

<p>Their second marked characteristic was their hierarchical
spirit, and their strong feeling for discipline. Insubordination
and conspiracy they always punished by death. Their
ideal government is illustrated by the inscription on a
funeral stone recently found in Mongolia. It was
erected in 733 A. D. by a Turkish prince to his brother
Kul Khan, the substance being as follows: “I and my
brother Kul Khan Tikine together have agreed that the
name and renown acquired by the Turkish people through
our father and uncle shall not be blotted out. For the sake
of the Turkish people I have not slept by night nor rested
by day.... I have given garments to the naked, I have
enriched the poor, I have made the few numerous, I have
honored the virtuous.... By the aid of Heaven, as I have
gained much, the Turkish people also have gained much.”</p>

<p>Another bit of evidence as to their early political ideals is
taken from <cite>The Art of Government</cite>, a didactic poem describing
Turkish society in the eleventh century.<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">2</a> It says
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">13</a></span>“Speak to the people with kindness, but do not let them
become familiar. Give them to eat and drink;” and it
urges the ruler to strive for the blessing of the poor by
such actions.</p>

<p><cite>The Art of Government</cite> brings out a third side of the
medieval Turk, his love of learning. The civil mandarins
are placed in rank above the beys.<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">3</a> “Honor always keeps
company with knowledge.” “Mark well, there are two
kinds of noble persons; the one is the bey, the other the
scholar, in this world below ... the former with his
glove or his fist commands the people, the latter with his
knowledge shows the path.”</p>

<p>Despite the development of the Turkish people from barbarous
tribes into a civilized state, the Ottoman Empire of
the sixteenth century was built on the lines indicated, and
Sultan Suleiman showed similar qualities and ideals to those
possessed by Kul Khan and his brother.</p>

<p>Towards the end of the tenth century, a branch of the
Turks, henceforth known as the Turcomans, accepted Islam
at the hands of the conquering Arabs, and in course of time
all of the Turkish peoples became Moslem. Naturally
through their religion the Arabs came to exert a strong influence
on the rude Turks, so strong that Turkish thought
has never since been wholly free from Arabic dominance.
The Turks are an exceedingly loyal people, accepting the
religion imposed upon them with whole‐heartedness. They
are not by nature fanatical; on the contrary they are temperamentally
tolerant, fanaticism where it has existed being
an outgrowth of political conditions, or a foreign trait
taken over with Islam.<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">4</a> Rather oddly, and perhaps unfor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">14</a></span>tunately,
when the Turks became literate they fell under Persian
rather than Arabic influence, and for centuries, indeed
up to our own century, Turkish literature has been little
more than an imitation of the Persian, very formal and
rhetorical. Thus the two great forces engaged in moulding
the Turkish mind were Arabic theology and Persian
poetry, the large Arabic and Persian element in the Turkish
language being a good illustration of this.</p>

<p>In the twelfth century the Asiatic hordes pressing into
Asia Minor came into contact with the Greeks. But there
was no intellectual reaction between Greek and Turk.</p>

<p>The Seljouk kingdom rose and fell in Asia Minor; then
the chieftain Othman<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">5</a> stepped on its ruins and climbed to
power. He and his descendants gradually conquered the
Greeks until Byzantium was theirs. Ottoman conquests still
continued, until a century, after the fall of Constantinople
Suleiman pushed his armies to the gates of Vienna and
marked the farthest point of the Turkish invasion of Europe.
During Suleiman’s reign Turkey not only dominated the
Balkan Peninsula from the Adriatic to the Black Sea and
north to the Danube, but it also greatly influenced the rest
of Europe. There was not a court in Europe that was not
forced to reckon with Sultan Suleiman. So the career of
Ibrahim, his distinguished grand vizir, is not a mere
romance; it is a career which intimately affected the hopes
and fears of Ferdinand of Austria, Charles V of Spain,
Francis I of France, and even Henry VIII of England, as
well as the Pope and the Venetian Signory.</p>

<p>At the height of their power the Turks were nevertheless
still a simple people. While western society has moved
from complexity to greater complexity, their society has
preserved an unembarrassed simplicity. They are loyal to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">15</a></span>
state, religion, race, family, habit. Their religion is rigidly
monotheistic; their government (up to July 24, 1908) has
been the simplest possible monarchy, a personal despotism;
they are probably the most unaffectedly democratic people
in the world; a man is what his merit or his fortune has
made him, with no regard to his ancestry; they are unitarian
in religion, government and society. In morals the
same simplicity prevails, with no torturing doubts and few
sophistries. Much that seems like a fairy tale to us is simple
unquestioning reality to them.</p>

<p>In this simplicity, this single‐mindedness, they are
totally different from the Arabs of the Khalifate, with
whom they have been so much associated in Western minds,
but with whom they have no relationship beyond that of a
common religion. The Turks, I repeat, are a much simpler
as well as a more warlike people than any other Oriental
nation.</p>

<p>The sources for the life of Ibrahim are classified naturally
in three groups: (1st) The Turkish histories and biographies,
first and second hand; (2nd) the accounts of European
travelers and residents in Constantinople, such as
Mouradjia D’Ohsson, Busbequius, and the Venetian baillies;
and (3rd) the diplomatic correspondence and documents
of the time as found in such collections as Charrière’s
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Négociations</i>, Gévay’s <i lang="de" xml:lang="de">Urkunden und Actenstücke</i>, and
Noradunghian’s and de Testa’s <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Recueils</i>. A student would
also wish to consult the histories written by foreigners, such
as von Hammer, Zinkheisen and Jorga, whose sources are
found in the three classes of evidence cited above.</p>

<p>It is impossible to confine ourselves to the Turkish
sources, because of the notable omission of accounts of institutions,
and the total absence of description. Abdurrahman
Sheref, the present historiographer of Turkey, is
the first Turkish writer of whom I know, who devotes some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">16</a></span>
chapters to general subjects such as “The Provinces”,
“Literature”, etc., in imitation of European histories. The
historians of Suleiman’s time were rather chroniclers, the
Comines and Froissarts of their day though with much less
of petty and personal detail. Therefore we must turn to
Occidental observers for accounts of the Turkish manner of
life, their warfare and their government, except where we
can learn from Turkish law or poetry. But practically all
that the Ottomans have told us of themselves and of their
rulers, we may trust in a way we cannot trust Western evidence.
Every one who knows the East is aware how a report
will pass through the bazaars and into the interior
of the country, or up the Nile for hundreds of miles, with
marvelous rapidity and more marvelous accuracy. Just
as the story‐teller repeats a tale as his remote ancestor first
told it, so do men hand down a tradition unembellished and
unchanged. Turkish tradition is an expression of the sincerity
and simplemindedness of the Turkish character. The
Turks are neither sceptics, nor desirous of deceiving, therefore
they transmit an account as they have received it.</p>

<p>There are of course exceptions to this: Suleiman’s <cite>Letters
of Victory</cite> are overdrawn at times, and a legendary
history of him has been found,<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">6</a> written a century after
his reign, in which the events of his life are hard to discover
amidst a mass of legend. But this last case seems
to have been a direct attempt to write an epic piece, and
is quite different from the clear, straight narrative of the
ordinary chronicler. The court chronicler’s embellishments
consist mainly in flowery phrases, such as “Sultan Suleiman
Khan, whose glory reaches the heavens, and who is
the Sun of Valor and Heroism, and the Shadow of God
on Earth, may Allah keep his soul.” In other words, the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">17</a></span>style is embellished but not the facts, the latter being related
as uncritically and directly as a child relates an event.</p>

<p>Sometimes the perspective seems to us very odd, since
the emphasis seems to be placed on the unimportant
part of the narrative, but in such cases we must seek in
the Turkish mind for an explanation of why that phase,
unimportant to us, is to the Turkish writer and reader, of
importance. As an illustration of this, take the Turkish
accounts of Ibrahim’s Egyptian expedition. The <cite>Sulimannameh</cite>
and later histories all give more space to the
hardships of Ibrahim’s voyage to Egypt, and to the honor
paid him by the Sultan than to the organization of Egypt,
which occupied seven months. This seems, and doubtless
is naïve, but we can see from it what a great effort a sea
expedition was to this inland people, and also how above
everything else in importance loomed the favor of the monarch,
by whom all subjects rose to power or fell into disgrace.
It further shows the stress laid on the lives of courtiers
and officials rather than on the ordering of a province,
in which, of course, it resembles all early histories.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER I<br /><br />

<small><span class="smcap">Ibrahim’s Rise</span></small></h2>

<p><span class="smcap">Ibrahim</span> was a Christian of base extraction, the son of
a Greek sailor of Parga.<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">7</a> He was born in 1494.<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">8</a> In his
childhood he was captured by Turkish corsairs.<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">9</a> It would
seem that he was first sold to a widow of Magnesia, who
clothed him well and had him well educated, and especially
trained to perform upon a musical instrument resembling
the violin, which he learned to play beautifully.<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">10</a></p>

<p>Whether it was on one of his expeditions to Asia Minor
that Suleiman, son of the reigning monarch Selim I, met
Ibrahim and was won by his charm and his musical ability,
or whether Ibrahim was taken to Constantinople and there
sold to the prince, cannot be determined from conflicting re<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">19</a></span>ports,
but the fact that Ibrahim became Suleiman’s property
is incontestable.<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">11</a></p>

<p>Ibrahim never forgot his origin or his family. In 1527
his father came to Constantinople to visit him, and later he
had his mother and his two brothers at the Palace.<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">12</a> He
was able to help his father substantially, giving him a
<em>sandjak</em> or governorship.<a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">13</a> Of course Ibrahim adopted
Islam, else there were no story to tell, for a Christian could
have had no career in Turkey in that day.</p>

<p>Baudier says that the boy Ibrahim was carried to Constantinople
by “them which exact the tribute of Christian
Children.” This tribute of Christian children had been
levied since the reign of Orkhan (1326–1361) and was the
material of which the redoubtable army of janissaries was
formed. These children, separated from their own countries
and their families, and practically always converted
to Islam, were for the most part trained in military camps
and forbidden to marry. Therefore they had no interest
except in war, and no loyalty except to the sultan. Thus
they developed into the finest military machine the world
had known, the most perfect instrument for a conqueror’s
use, but a dangerous force in time of peace.</p>

<p>Sometimes the tribute children were bred for civil careers
and not placed in the corps of the janissaries. Prince
Cantimir of Moldavia<a name="FNanchor_14_14" id="FNanchor_14_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">14</a> states that Ibrahim was a simple
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">20</a></span>janissary of the 9th company. I have been unable to find
a source for this statement, but Ibrahim’s later career as
general of the Imperial forces would seem to imply a military
training. Von Hammer,<a name="FNanchor_15_15" id="FNanchor_15_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">15</a> however, ascribes Cantimir’s
statement to an error, and gives Ibrahim a civil training.</p>

<p>Ibrahim’s first office was page to the heir apparent Suleiman.
When the latter came to the throne in 1520, he made
Ibrahim Head Falconer, and then raised him in rapid succession
to the respective posts of Khass‐oda‐Bashi, or Master
of the Household, of Beylerbey of Roumelie, Vizir, Grand
Vizir, and finally Serasker, or general‐in‐chief of the Imperial
forces—a dazzlingly rapid promotion. Baudier tells
a story in this connection which might easily be true, being
quite in character, although it can not be verified. The
story runs thus: “Ibrahim’s rapid rise began to alarm him.
The inconstancy of fortune, as exampled by the fate of
many of the great men of the Ottoman court, created in
him an apprehension of the great peril which attached to
those favorites who enjoyed the high dignities of the court,
and served as a bridle to restrain his desires. He besought
Suleiman not to advance him so high that his fall would be
his ruin. He showed him that a modest prosperity was
safer than the greatness wherewith he would honor him;
that his services would be rewarded sufficiently if he received
enough to enable him to pass his days in rest and
comfort. Suleiman commended his modesty, but meaning
to advance him to the chief dignities of the empire, he swore
that Ibrahim should not be put to death as long as he
reigned, no matter what other changes might be made in
the court.” “But” moralizes Baudier, “the condition of
kings, which is human and subject to change, and that of
favorites, who are proud and unthankful, shall cause Sulei<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">21</a></span>man
to fail of his promise and Ibrahim to lose his faith and
loyalty as we shall see”.<a name="FNanchor_16_16" id="FNanchor_16_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor">16</a></p>

<p>A knowledge of the duties of these offices held by Ibrahim
is essential to an understanding of the Turkish court at
which his life was spent.<a name="FNanchor_17_17" id="FNanchor_17_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_17" class="fnanchor">17</a> The personal servants of the sultan
were divided into six classes or “chambers”; the Body
guard, the Guard of the treasury, the Guard of the office,
the Guard of the campaign, the Black eunuchs and the
White eunuchs. The Body guard, or personal attendants,
included the Master of the stirrup, the Master of the keys,
the Chief water‐pourer, the Chief coffee‐server, etcetera, to
the number of thirty‐nine. The first of these chambers was
well furnished with attendants, mutes, dwarfs, musicians,
and pages; some of these pages were attached to the personal
service of high officials, whose pipes, coffee, or perfumes
they tended; they might also be attached to the service
of the sultan. Ibrahim seems to have been a page in
the service of the <em>shahzadeh</em> or heir, Suleiman.</p>

<p>The heir to the throne after his thirteenth or fourteenth
year had his own palace separate from his father’s harem,
in which he had thus far been brought up. As soon as he
showed sufficient promise he was sent to some province, that
he might have experience in governing. Thus Suleiman,
during the reign of his father Selim, was made governor of
Magnesia in Asia Minor, north of Smyrna, where he probably
met Ibrahim, a youth of his own age. The court of
the <em>shahzadeh</em> had the same officials, with the same titles, as
the Imperial court.</p>

<p>It was then in Suleiman’s court in Magnesia that Ibrahim
held his position as page. The pages in the sultan’s
palace at Constantinople attended schools especially de<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">22</a></span>signed
to train them, and Ibrahim, when he became grand
vizir, founded one of the best of these schools in Stamboul.
Probably there were no such schools in the provinces, but
either in the palace, or earlier in the household of the widow
of Magnesia, Ibrahim obtained an excellent education.</p>

<p>He could read Persian as well as Turkish, also Greek
(his native tongue) and Italian. He was a wide reader,
delighting in geography and history, especially the lives of
Alexander the Great and Hannibal. Of his musical training
we have already spoken.<a name="FNanchor_18_18" id="FNanchor_18_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_18" class="fnanchor">18</a> When their schooling was completed,
the pages were taken into the Serai,<a name="FNanchor_19_19" id="FNanchor_19_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_19" class="fnanchor">19</a> passing through
two lower chambers before completing their education in
the first chamber. The pages usually lodged near the
sultan’s apartments in handsome dormitories having their
own mosque and baths. But Ibrahim, as the favorite of
Suleiman, used to sleep in the apartments of his lord and
master, and generally took his meals with him.<a name="FNanchor_20_20" id="FNanchor_20_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_20" class="fnanchor">20</a> Bragadino
says that when they were not together in the morning they
wrote notes to each other, which they sent by mutes.
Pietro Zen records seeing them together often in a little
boat with but one oarsman, and says they would land at
Seraglio Point and wander through the gardens together.<a name="FNanchor_21_21" id="FNanchor_21_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_21" class="fnanchor">21</a>
Zen declares that the Grand Signor loved Ibrahim greatly,
and that the two were inseparable from childhood up, continuing
so after Suleiman became sultan. This intimacy, so
often noted by the Venetian Baillies, is never commented
on by the Turkish writers. It scandalized the Ottomans,
and seemed to them utterly unsuitable that the Lord of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">23</a></span>the Age should show such favor to his slave. The partiality
of Suleiman for Ibrahim is important, for it is the
explanation of Ibrahim’s phenomenal rise.</p>

<p>From a page, Ibrahim became Head Falconer, a post
which requires no explanation. The last two chambers of
the sultan’s personal attendants were the black and white
eunuchs. The black eunuchs, several hundred in number,
guarded the imperial harem, and were thence called aghas
of the harem. Their chief was called <em>Kizlar agha</em>, or <em>agha</em>
of the maidens, and his office included some further duties
beside those connected with the “maidens.” There were
also in the palace a number of white eunuchs, whose chief
was called <em>Capon agha</em>, or captain of the gate. Next to him
the chief officer was the Khass‐oda‐bashi. The Turkish
historians<a name="FNanchor_22_22" id="FNanchor_22_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_22" class="fnanchor">22</a> call Ibrahim, at the time of his being called to
the vizirate, “khass‐oda‐bashi.” Cantimir calls him “Captain
of the Inner Palace” which is a very good translation
of the Turkish term. This official, as we have seen, was
second in rank among the white eunuchs. To him was
confided one of the three imperial seals set in rings, used
for the precious objects which were kept in the apartment
of the sultan.<a name="FNanchor_23_23" id="FNanchor_23_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_23" class="fnanchor">23</a></p>

<p>He also garbed in <em>caftans</em><a name="FNanchor_24_24" id="FNanchor_24_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_24" class="fnanchor">24</a> in the Imperial presence those
whom the sultan would thus honor. Another curious duty
was the following: whenever the sultan had his head shaved,
and the personal attendants stood in order before him; their
hands crossed respectfully over their girdles, the khass‐oda‐bashi
placed himself several steps from the sofa, on which
the sultan sat, his right hand resting on a baton chased with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">24</a></span>gold and silver. The white eunuchs lodged behind the third
gate of the palace, the Bab‐el‐saadet, or Gate of Felicity.
D’Ohsson states:<a name="FNanchor_25_25" id="FNanchor_25_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_25" class="fnanchor">25</a> “The seraglio is their prison and their
tomb; they are never permitted to absent themselves. The
white eunuchs have no other prospect than the post of Commandant
of the school of pages at Galata.”</p>

<p>It would seem that Ibrahim must have been a eunuch.
Daniele Barbarigo states it flatly<a name="FNanchor_26_26" id="FNanchor_26_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_26" class="fnanchor">26</a> and the office of khass‐oda‐bashi,
according to D’Ohsson, was held only by
eunuchs. Furthermore Solakzadeh speaks of Ibrahim’s
being called from the Imperial harem to the grand vizirate,
and all the officials of the harem were necessarily
eunuchs. But to Ibrahim the seraglio was neither a prison
nor a tomb. He went freely about the city, and his rise
was not at all impeded by what generally proved a fatal
limitation. Other eunuchs have also overcome their limitations,
for D’Ohsson mentions four eunuchs, kizlar aghas,
who became grand vizirs. Another very distinguished
eunuch, Ghazanber Agha, a Hungarian prisoner‐of‐war,
in childhood was educated as a page in the serai, became
a Mahommedan and, because Selim II, the son and successor
of Suleiman the Magnificent, wanted him about his
person, he voluntarily submitted to castration, in order to
enter the corps of white eunuchs. His office was capou
agha (captain of the gate) which he held for thirty years,
and raised to a very great importance.</p>

<p>That Ibrahim married need not astonish us, for marriages
arranged with eunuchs by fathers of many daughters
were not uncommon. Sometimes a sultana was married
to a eunuch for his fortune, in which case he generally
died soon after his marriage; sometimes no other suit<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">25</a></span>able
husband being found for her, she was given to a eunuch
of high rank. In stories we occasionally read of a father
who marries his daughter to a eunuch as a punishment.
Ibrahim probably married a sultana, which
curiously enough would be a more natural marriage than
with a woman of lower rank, for it has never been deemed
advisable that the daughters of sultans should have male
children, and if such were born, they were condemned to
immediate death by the omission to knot the umbilical
cord. This measure became a law in the reign of Ahmed
I,<a name="FNanchor_27_27" id="FNanchor_27_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_27_27" class="fnanchor">27</a> with the idea of saving the country from the civil war
of rival princes of the blood, but was probably a custom
long before it was legalized. Therefore Suleiman may have
thought that the marriage of his relative to a man of Ibrahim’s
position, fortune, and charm, was a happy fate for a
princess who might not hope to be a mother.</p>

<p>We have seen that the fact that Ibrahim was a Greek, and
a Christian by birth, was no barrier to his rise, so long as
he adopted Islam. Many of the great officials of Turkey
were of Christian extraction; as for instance, the two men
who succeeded Ibrahim Pasha as Grand Vizirs, Rustem
Pasha and Mehmet Sokolli, considered the greatest of
Turkish vizirs and both Croats by birth. Furthermore his
humble family was no obstacle, for in Turkey it has always
been possible for a bootblack or a grocer to rise to the highest
position, if good fortune or marked ability led him
thither.</p>

<p>Ibrahim suffered from still another disability, as we in
the Occident would consider it: he was a slave. How did
that affect his advancement? To understand the position
of a slave in Turkey in the fifteenth century we must recognize
at the outset the fact that Turkish slavery was quite
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">26</a></span>different from that of the Occident, and so approach the
subject free from our natural prejudice.</p>

<p>The only slavery sanctioned by Islam is that imposed on
infidels as a result of supposed inferiority of race and religion,<a name="FNanchor_28_28" id="FNanchor_28_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_28_28" class="fnanchor">28</a>
and has never in fact included the <em>rayahs</em> (Christian
subjects) but only prisoners of war. The <em>rayah</em> might not
be enslaved but neither might he hold slaves, except in very
rare instances before 1759, and not at all after that date.<a name="FNanchor_29_29" id="FNanchor_29_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_29_29" class="fnanchor">29</a></p>

<p>There were two kinds of legal slaves, those made by capture
in war, and those by birth. Slaves by purchase, taken
from Africa and the Caucasus, were not recognized by law,
but nevertheless such slavery existed.<a name="FNanchor_30_30" id="FNanchor_30_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_30_30" class="fnanchor">30</a> Brigands also seized
foreigners from time to time and sold them as slaves. Prisoners
of war lost their civil liberty according to Islamic
law. The Prophet repeatedly enjoins their destruction.<a name="FNanchor_31_31" id="FNanchor_31_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_31_31" class="fnanchor">31</a>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">27</a></span>
According to the Turkish code, the sovereign might perpetuate
their captivity, or free them to pay tribute, or cause
them to be slaughtered, if more expedient. The exceptions
to this law were the cases of any orthodox Moslems who
might fall into Turkish power, and the case of the Tatars
of the Crimea, who were Shiites, or heretic Moslems, and
who were enslaved.<a name="FNanchor_32_32" id="FNanchor_32_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_32_32" class="fnanchor">32</a></p>

<p>Prisoners of war formed two classes of slaves, prisoners
of the state, and private slaves. To the first class belonged
all soldiers and officers, and a fifth of the rest of the slaves,
or their value. Of these some were exchanged or resold
after the peace, others were employed in the Serai or given
away. Some were handed over to public works, especially
to the admiralty, where they were confounded with criminals
and condemned to hard labor. To the second class
belonged all the prisoners not given to the sultan, including
those captured by the soldiers. These were generally sold.
Merchants would purchase them in the camps, and sell them
all over the Empire. These slaves taken in war were far
the greater number of slaves in the Empire; many were
enfranchised before they had children, and children of one
free and one slave parent were themselves born free. The
adoption of Islam after captivity did not free the slave.</p>

<p>The power of the master was absolute over the person,
children and property of his slaves. He might sell, give, or
bequeath them, but he might not kill them without some
reason. As a corollary of this power, the master had full
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">28</a></span>responsibility for his slave; he must support him, pay his
debts, stand behind him in any civil affair, and give consent
to his holding of property. A slave might not act as a
witness nor as a guardian. He was entirely dependent on
his master.</p>

<p>Thus far the theory is not unlike that of the West, but
there were two facts which changed the entire situation.
The first was the brevity of time of enslavement in most
cases; the second was the absence of odium attached to the
position of a slave. In regard to the first fact, it was not
considered humane to keep persons long in slavery, and it
was a general rule to enfranchise them either before their
marriage or on their coming of age, or when they had
served sufficiently long. Enfranchisement is a voluntary and
private act by which the patron frees his slave from the
bonds of servitude and puts him into the free class.<a name="FNanchor_33_33" id="FNanchor_33_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_33_33" class="fnanchor">33</a> It is
also considered by the Turk to be a noble action, one especially
befitting a dying man, who often frees his slaves in
his testament. The enfranchisement of slaves was regarded
by the Moslem as the highest act of virtue.<a name="FNanchor_34_34" id="FNanchor_34_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_34_34" class="fnanchor">34</a> A less disinterested
form of enfranchisement has a pecuniary inducement,
the slave buying his freedom from his master.<a name="FNanchor_35_35" id="FNanchor_35_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_35_35" class="fnanchor">35</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">29</a></span></p>

<p>Thus the slave never thought of himself as by nature
servile, nor always to be a slave, but could look forward to
his freedom in a few years more or less. This fact induced
self‐respect and hope. The slave’s dress did not in any way
distinguish him from the free man; he was in no way
branded.</p>

<p>Sir Henry Bulwer said of white slavery in Turkey in
1850, “It greatly resembles adoption, and the children often
become the first dignitaries of the Empire.”<a name="FNanchor_36_36" id="FNanchor_36_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_36_36" class="fnanchor">36</a> This statement
is confirmed by Fatma Alieh Hannum, a living
Turkish lady, who gives a most attractive picture of the
home care and affection given to slaves,<a name="FNanchor_37_37" id="FNanchor_37_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_37_37" class="fnanchor">37</a> and my own observation
of slavery in Constantinople would bear her out.
The condition described by Bulwer would seem also to have
obtained in the sixteenth century. George Young in his
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Corps de Droit Ottoman</i><a name="FNanchor_38_38" id="FNanchor_38_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_38_38" class="fnanchor">38</a> speaks of two systems of slavery
in Turkey, the Turkish system and the Circassian system,
which have been fused in our day, but of which only the
former existed in Ibrahim’s day, and in contrasting them he
says: “The Turkish system by its moderation scarcely went
beyond the limits of apprenticeship, and could be classed
with the voluntary servitude that for a determined time
was permitted in some of the European colonies. While
the Circassian system fixed the slave forever in the servile
class, the Turkish system has always permitted and in some
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">30</a></span>cases prescribed his enfranchisement. Furthermore the social
situation of a slave under the Old Regime of the Empire
favored his advancement even to the highest office....
The Turkish system made a career of slavery.... Many
slaves by birth have played leading roles in the history of
the Empire.” The last statement admits of no argument,
but the question how far the Turkish system made a career
of slavery, and how far slavery was beneficent, demands
further consideration.</p>

<p>Let us return to the classes of slaves spoken of above.
Some, we saw, were put into public works; these could
have found no career in their forced labor, although they
might have bought or otherwise earned their freedom, and
then have made a career for themselves. Some were owned
by private individuals where they were given no opportunity
to rise, although life in a private house, as in the
case of the widow of Magnesia, might prepare a slave for
a career. But the only slaves who would naturally have
an opportunity for a career were those who served in the
royal palace or in the house of some important officer. To
them slavery truly opened a career. We cannot perhaps
agree with Mr. Young that the Turkish system “made a
career of slavery”, but it certainly was no barrier to a
career, and it even opened up such opportunities as could
not come otherwise to a Christian youth, nor indeed to most
Moslem youths.</p>

<p>The mild and even beneficent quality of Oriental slavery
has been maintained by many writers. Busbequius, writing
from Constantinople in Suleiman’s reign, commends Turkish
slavery on economic grounds, and then, moved by the
contemplation of this fatherly system, bursts into a defence
of slavery in general.<a name="FNanchor_39_39" id="FNanchor_39_39"></a><a href="#Footnote_39_39" class="fnanchor">39</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">31</a></span></p>
<p>Robert Roberts in his monograph says that the condition
of slaves in modern Moslem lands is “not so bad”, and
that the slavery he himself saw in Morocco “is only formally
to be distinguished from Christian service”.<a name="FNanchor_40_40" id="FNanchor_40_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_40_40" class="fnanchor">40</a> The Baron
de Tott speaks of seeing Moslem slaves in 1785 “well fed,
well clothed, and well treated,” and adds, “I am inclined
to doubt if those even who are homesick have in general
much reason to be satisfied with their ransom. It is possible
in truth that the slaves sold into the interior parts of the
country, or to individuals who purchase them on speculation,
are not as happy as those who fall to the lot of the sovereign
or the grandee. We may presume, however, that even the
avarice of the master militates in their favor, for it must
be confessed that the Europeans are the only people who
ill‐treat their slaves, which arises no doubt from this cause,—that
they constitute the wealth of the Orientals, and that
with us they are means of amassing wealth. In the East
they are the delight of the miser; with us they are only the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">32</a></span>instrument of avarice.”<a name="FNanchor_41_41" id="FNanchor_41_41"></a><a href="#Footnote_41_41" class="fnanchor">41</a> In interesting support of de
Tott’s idea that Oriental slaves might not care to be ransomed
is the fact that after the treaty of Carlowitz, when
the Porte engaged to set European prisoners at liberty
for a ransom, and did attempt to do so, there were a large
number of captives who rejected their liberty and their
fatherland.<a name="FNanchor_42_42" id="FNanchor_42_42"></a><a href="#Footnote_42_42" class="fnanchor">42</a></p>

<p>Perhaps the chief explanation of the lack of distinction
between freeman and slave lay in the fact that the Turks had
very little conception of freedom, and the man legally free
was practically almost as bound as the slave. As we have
seen in the introduction to this study, loyalty and obedience
were the two great virtues in the eyes of the Turks, so that
in the idea of service there was no degradation. All who
served the Crown were called <em>Kol</em>, or slaves of the Sultan,
even the grand vizir receiving this title, which was much
more honorable than that of <em>subject</em>, the kol being able to
insult the subject with impunity, while the latter could not
injure a royal slave in the slightest degree without subjecting
himself to punishment.<a name="FNanchor_43_43" id="FNanchor_43_43"></a><a href="#Footnote_43_43" class="fnanchor">43</a> Turkey was a land of slaves
with but one master, the sultan, even the brothers and sons
of the monarch being kept in durance for the greater part
of their lives. In the case of women, no practical distinction
that we should recognize existed between slave and free.
The mother of the sultan was always a slave, one of the sultan’s
titles being “Son of a Slave”. Most of the pashas were
born of slave mothers, as the Turks had more children by
their slaves than by their wives.<a name="FNanchor_44_44" id="FNanchor_44_44"></a><a href="#Footnote_44_44" class="fnanchor">44</a> Such conditions rendered
obviously impossible the sharp line which is drawn in the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">33</a></span>West between the freeman and the despised slave, and
placed the slave potentially with the highest of the land.
Slavery was certainly the Greek Ibrahim’s opportunity.
Slavery brought him into the court, placed him before the
sultan, educated him, gave him ambition, and finally gratified
it. When Ibrahim was freed, no one thinks it worth
while to record; certainly before his marriage, perhaps
much before. But evidently the moment when Suleiman
said to him: “Thou art enfranchised, thou art free”<a name="FNanchor_45_45" id="FNanchor_45_45"></a><a href="#Footnote_45_45" class="fnanchor">45</a> was
a moment not worth recording, so natural and inevitable
was his enfranchisement the moment that slavery ceased to
be the ladder of his advancement.</p>

<p>It is evident, then, that Ibrahim’s lowly birth, his Christian
origin, his experience as a slave, and his being a eunuch were
none of them barriers to a great career. What was there,
on the other hand, to give him such a career? His extraordinary
ambition, his marked ability, and above all his immense
good‐fortune in falling into the hands of the sultan
and winning his affection, so that Suleiman was dominated
by his love for Ibrahim, and unable to resist any of his
caprices;<a name="FNanchor_46_46" id="FNanchor_46_46"></a><a href="#Footnote_46_46" class="fnanchor">46</a> these were the prime factors in his extraordinary
rise.</p>

<p>While still master of the household (khass‐oda‐bashi) he
was often spoken of as “Ibrahim the Magnificent” by the
Venetian baillies. Barbarigo relates that the serai was
never so splendid as in the days when the magnificent Ibrahim
was oda‐bashi of the Grand Seigneur, and also when
he was grand chamberlain. As the title of “the Magnificent”
is that which Europe has accorded to Sultan Suleiman,
a love of pomp and display must have been one of the
interests that he and his ennobled slave had in common.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">34</a></span>But such showy qualities are hardly suitable to a mere
master of the household. Ibrahim had to be raised to the
rank of pasha.</p>

<p>A pasha was a sort of military governor, although the
title might be given as a mere title of nobility, and in any
case was indefinite, being determined by the particular
office the pasha held. The pashas were generally very proud
and stately persons, with grave, leisurely manners, and were
always surrounded by a large number of pages and other
richly‐garbed domestics when they went abroad mounted
on superb steeds, banners and horse‐tails waving before
them, and the people paying homage. But their power was
often very small, and their income frequently quite inadequate
to the state they were obliged to maintain.<a name="FNanchor_47_47" id="FNanchor_47_47"></a><a href="#Footnote_47_47" class="fnanchor">47</a></p>

<p>The famous horse‐tail banner which distinguished a high
official originated in the following way: the banner of one
of the old Turkish princes having been lost in battle and
with it the courage of his soldiers, he severed with one blow
a horse’s tail from its body and fastening it to his lance
cried, “Behold my banner! who loves me will follow me!”
The Turks rallied and saved the day.<a name="FNanchor_48_48" id="FNanchor_48_48"></a><a href="#Footnote_48_48" class="fnanchor">48</a> The banner was
called the <em>Tugh</em>. Each sandjak bey was entitled to one
horse‐tail, being, as Europeans say “a pasha of one tail”; a
beylerbey (literally prince of princes or colonel of colonels)
was entitled to two or three tails; the grand vizir sported
five horse‐tails, and before the Sultan seven of these banners
were carried.</p>

<p>In 1522 Ibrahim became Ibrahim Pasha, Grand Vizir,
and Beylerbey of Roumelie. Turkey has always been
divided into Turkey in Europe, or Roumelie or Roum,<a name="FNanchor_49_49" id="FNanchor_49_49"></a><a href="#Footnote_49_49" class="fnanchor">49</a> and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">35</a></span>Turkey in Asia, or Anatolia. These two divisions of the
empire during Suleiman’s reign were each ruled by a governor,
or beylerbey, who had general charge of the sandjakbeys
over each sandjak<a name="FNanchor_50_50" id="FNanchor_50_50"></a><a href="#Footnote_50_50" class="fnanchor">50</a> or province. The beylerbeys
of Roumelie generally resided at Monastir or Sofia, but here
again Ibrahim seems to have been an exception to the general
rule and to have resided at Constantinople.</p>

<p>The office of vizir was a venerable one, its institution being
ascribed by some to the Prophet, who appointed as first
vizir Ali, his son‐in‐law and successor, and by others to the
first Abasside, who bestowed the title on his first minister.
The duties of vizir in the sixteenth century have been defined
as follows:<a name="FNanchor_51_51" id="FNanchor_51_51"></a><a href="#Footnote_51_51" class="fnanchor">51</a> “The vizir commands all the armies, is
the only one except the Grand Seigneur who has the power
of life and death throughout the whole extent of the Empire
over criminals, and can nominate, degrade, and execute all
ministers and agents of the sovereign authority. He promulgates
all the new laws, and causes them to be put in
effect. He is the supreme head of the justice that he administers,
although with the aid and according to the opinion
of the Ulema, the legal body. In short, he represents his
master to the full extent of his dignity and temporal power,
not only in the Empire, but also with the Foreign States.
But to the same degree that this power is splendid and extensive,
it is dangerous and precarious.”</p>

<p>Mourad I (1359–1389) was the first sultan of Turkey to
name a vizir. Mohammed the Conqueror thought the office
concentrated too much power in one person, and planned to
abolish it, but instead left it vacant for eight months.<a name="FNanchor_52_52" id="FNanchor_52_52"></a><a href="#Footnote_52_52" class="fnanchor">52</a>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">36</a></span>Selim I, as strong a monarch as the Conqueror, left vacant
for nine months this office which almost rendered a sultan
unnecessary. But his son Suleiman soon after his accession
put his favorite Ibrahim into the highest office in a sultan’s
gift, and kept him there thirteen years. Probably with the
idea of dividing the immense power of this office, he increased
the number of vizirs to three and later to four. Of
these one was known as the grand vizir (Vizir Azam) and
to him alone applies the description given above. Ibrahim
Pasha was at first the third vizir, the other two being Piri
Mustafa Pasha and Ahmed Pasha. There was always great
jealousy among the vizirs. Ahmed Pasha, anxious to rise
to the first rank, accused Piri Pasha of sedition and procured
the latter’s downfall; but to his inexpressible chagrin was
himself passed over in favor of Ibrahim, who was “told the
good news of his appointment as grand vizir and brought
gladness and brilliance into the divan.”<a name="FNanchor_53_53" id="FNanchor_53_53"></a><a href="#Footnote_53_53" class="fnanchor">53</a> Ahmed’s feeling
was so great and the consequent dissensions in the divan
were so considerable, that Suleiman sent Ahmed to Egypt
as governor, leaving the field clear for Ibrahim, who in his
palace received at the hands of a noble of the sultan’s service
the imperial ring as a symbol of his new power.</p>

<p>The grand vizir lived in a palace modeled after the Sultan’s,
having under him the same class of officials and servants
even to ministers of state, and his household was conducted
with great ceremony. Ibrahim’s salary was increased over
that of the preceding grand vizir from 16,000 to 25,000
piastres<a name="FNanchor_54_54" id="FNanchor_54_54"></a><a href="#Footnote_54_54" class="fnanchor">54</a> but he obtained much more from the disposal of
public offices, and he also received enormous presents from
those under him, although this was balanced by the large
gifts he had to make to others. The property of a grand
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">37</a></span>vizir was always confiscated at his death, which was doubtless
one reason why a sultan could afford to lavish so much
on a favorite minister, knowing that eventually it would all
return to the imperial coffers. Dress and style were very
carefully regulated in Turkey in the XVI century. The turban
of the grand vizir, his barge with twelve pairs of oars
and a green awning, the five horse‐tails that might be carried
before him, all distinguished him from lower officials. He
had eight guards of honor, and twelve led horses. When
he appeared in public his hussars would cry aloud, “Peace
unto you and divine clemence”, while the other soldiers responded
in chorus, “May your fortunes be propitious; may
Allah be your aid; may the Almighty protect the days of
our sovereign and the pasha, our master; may they live long
and happily.”<a name="FNanchor_55_55" id="FNanchor_55_55"></a><a href="#Footnote_55_55" class="fnanchor">55</a> All of the public officials except the sheik‐ul‐Islam
received their offices from the grand vizir, and were
garbed in his presence with a caftan, or robe of state. The
grand vizir and the sheik‐ul‐Islam were the only officials
invested by the sultan himself and appointed for life.</p>

<p>The divan was the imperial council, consisting of the
vizirs, the defterdar, or secretary of finance, the nishanji
who made out royal firmans and berats, and the sheik‐ul‐Islam
or head of Islam. It was a council for discussion and
wholly without power.</p>

<p>On the 22d day of May, 1524, the Sultan celebrated with
great pomp the marriage of Ibrahim Pasha. Who the bride
was we cannot be certain, but this is in accord with Turkish
etiquette which strictly forbids all mention of the harem,<a name="FNanchor_56_56" id="FNanchor_56_56"></a><a href="#Footnote_56_56" class="fnanchor">56</a>
and considers any public knowledge of woman as an insult
to her, thus depriving historians of desirable information
concerning such important political figures as Roxelana, who
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">38</a></span>greatly influenced Suleiman the Magnificent, Baffa the Venetian
sultana, and others. Von Hammer says that Ibrahim
married a sister of Suleiman, but I can find no proof of it.<a name="FNanchor_57_57" id="FNanchor_57_57"></a><a href="#Footnote_57_57" class="fnanchor">57</a>
A wedding in Turkey always includes two distinct feasts,
the one for the bride and her women friends, the other for
the groom and his men friends. Now‐a‐days the woman’s
part is ordinarily more important, but in Ibrahim’s time a
wedding or a circumcision was the occasion of a great public
feast for the men. Ibrahim Pasha, as we have seen, was
always spoken of by the Venetians as “Il Magnifico Ibrahim.”
Perhaps since so much stress has been laid by historians
on the splendor of the court and the grand vizir, a
description of this great public marriage will not be out of
order.<a name="FNanchor_58_58" id="FNanchor_58_58"></a><a href="#Footnote_58_58" class="fnanchor">58</a></p>

<p>The feast or series of feasts was held in the Hippodrome,
a great piazza being erected near Agia Sophia from which
the sultan might view all the proceedings. Here was set
up the Blessed Throne of Felicity, adorned with precious
gold embroidery and rich velvets, while in the Hippodrome
below, artistic, vari‐colored tents were set up, and
carpets of gold thread were spread over the ground.
Terraces and canopies and pavilions for the nobles were
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">39</a></span>raised above the ground, but below the sultan’s terrace.
Hangings of velvet and satin covered the grey walls of the
buildings surrounding the Hippodrome.<a name="FNanchor_59_59" id="FNanchor_59_59"></a><a href="#Footnote_59_59" class="fnanchor">59</a> The second vizir,
Ayas Pasha, and the agha of the janissaries went to the
palace to invite the sultan to honor the feast by his presence.
Suleiman received them graciously, delivered a pompous
eulogy upon Ibrahim, and made them rich presents.</p>

<p>To the first banquet “all the world” was invited;<a name="FNanchor_60_60" id="FNanchor_60_60"></a><a href="#Footnote_60_60" class="fnanchor">60</a> the
seven that followed were given to various branches of the
army, there being very splendid feasts to the janissaries,
vizirs, beylerbeys and sandjakbeys. To the first feast came
Ayas Pasha and the agha of the janissaries, escorted by a
troop of slaves. When they reached Bab‐el‐Saadet, that
gate of the city leading from the Seraglio grounds to the
space before the Agia Sophia, they met the glorious sultan
“whose throne is in the heavens.” His escort bore
scarlet banners and carried robes of honor with which they
garbed those who had come to meet them, and they led
also richly caparisoned steeds to present to Ayas Pasha and
his two followers, for which, says Solakzadeh, “there was
limitless thanks.”</p>

<p>On the ninth day, the eve of that on which the bride would
be brought from the palace, Ayas Pasha and the other
vizirs, and the defterdar, and the agha of the janissaries
sought the bridegroom and led him through the streets of
Stamboul in gorgeous procession. From the Bab‐i‐Huma<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">40</a></span>youn
(The Sublime Porte) to the Hippodrome the streets
“were full of pleasure from end to end,” all hung with
silks of Broussa and velvets of Damascus, through which
passed the ranks of the janissaries and the vizir who thus
honored Ibrahim Pasha.</p>

<p>Ibrahim was a lean, dark man, slight in stature and bearing
himself gracefully in his cloth‐of‐gold robes.<a name="FNanchor_61_61" id="FNanchor_61_61"></a><a href="#Footnote_61_61" class="fnanchor">61</a> He was
escorted by brilliant officers on prancing steeds. There is
no finer setting for a procession than the grey streets of
Stamboul under the vivid Southern sky. When the procession
approached the sultan’s throne, the dignitaries of
the state and the nobles of the Empire, approaching on foot
over the richly carpeted street, fell on their faces before his
Majesty.</p>

<p>“This day they enjoyed riches and booty and sumptuousness
without end”. “Especially were the people charmed
with the sounds of rejoicing flutes and trumpets, whose
music rose from earth to the first heaven”. The wise ulema
and sheiks were present on this occasion, the sultan seating
on his right the venerated Mufti Ali Djemali and on his left
the great hodja (teacher) of the princes, while other learned
doctors were arranged confronting the Imperial Majesty.
The sultan presided over a learned discussion of the verse
from the Koran, “O David, I will make thee Caliph in
the world”, a sufficiently courtly text. The meaning was
discussed and questions were propounded and answered.
After this literary episode, knights‐at‐arms, wrestlers and
other athletes displayed their skill. Then a rich feast was
served and Mehmet Chelebi had the honor of presenting to the
sultan sherbet in a priceless cup cut from a single turquoise,
a souvenir of Persian victories, and the pride of the nation.
Others drank their sherbet from goblets of china, then a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">41</a></span>rare and valuable ware. Food was served to the sultan and
the ulema on silver trays,<a name="FNanchor_62_62" id="FNanchor_62_62"></a><a href="#Footnote_62_62" class="fnanchor">62</a> and each of the guests took away
with him a tray of sweetmeats. From evening to morning
fireworks and illuminations lit up the city, and were reflected
in the Bosphorus and Marmora. On his return to
the palace Suleiman was informed of the birth of a son,
who afterwards became Selim II.</p>

<p>The wedding was followed by several days of dancing,
races, contests of wrestlers and archers, as well as poetic
contests in honor of the newly‐wedded couple. Such was a
public festival in the city of the sultan in the days of the
magnificent Suleiman. It reminds us of the Field of the
Cloth of Gold, whose splendor delighted the French and
the English in this same quarter century, the most striking
difference being the literary side which the Turkish festival
possessed and the European lacked.</p>

<p>Solakzadeh tells an interesting anecdote in connection
with another great feast, that of the circumcision of Suleiman’s
three sons.<a name="FNanchor_63_63" id="FNanchor_63_63"></a><a href="#Footnote_63_63" class="fnanchor">63</a> This was also a very splendid function
and Suleiman is said to have asked Ibrahim in pride, whose
feast had been the finer, Ibrahim’s or that of his sons. Ibrahim
replied: “There has never been a feast equal to my
wedding.” Suleiman, somewhat disconcerted, enquired how
that was, to which Ibrahim gave the following courtly answer:
“O my Padisha, my wedding was honored by the
presence of Suleiman, Lord of the Age, firm Rampart of
Islam, Possessor of Mecca and Medina, Lord of Damascus
and Egypt, Caliph of the Lofty Threshold, and Lord of the
Residence of the Pleiades: but to your festival, who was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">42</a></span>there of equally exalted rank who might come?” The
padisha, greatly delighted, said, “A thousand bravas to thee,
Ibrahim, who hast explained it so satisfactorily.”</p>

<p>Of Ibrahim’s relations to the sultan a good deal has been
said. He was brought up in close contact with his master,
eating and sleeping with him. They often changed garments
and Ibrahim told an Austrian ambassador that the
sultan never ordered garments for himself without ordering
the same for his favorite. The Venetians spoke of seeing
the two friends taking pleasure rides together in a cäique,
and visiting what shores they pleased.</p>

<p>Ibrahim was said to exert such an influence on the sultan
that the latter could deny him nothing, and from the time
that he became grand vizir, he almost took over the sovereignty
of the land: as von Hammer says, “from this time
he divided the absolute power with Suleiman”. In becoming
grand vizir and presiding over the divan, Ibrahim occupied
the highest position open to any except a member of
the imperial Ottoman family. Here the romantic story
of his rise merges into the account of his public career, and
this in its turn is a part of Turkish and South European
history.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER II<br /><br />

<small><span class="smcap">Ibrahim the Administrator</span></small></h2>

<p><span class="smcap">After</span> 1522 Ibrahim Pasha combined in his person the
highest administrative, diplomatic and military functions.
Although these naturally interact, it is our plan to consider
them separately, first taking up Ibrahim’s administrative
work.</p>

<p>We have seen that Ahmed Pasha, second vizir, was sent
to Egypt when Ibrahim climbed over him to the grand vizerate.
Ahmed’s indignation at the treatment accorded him
by Suleiman led him into treachery; he attempted to usurp
the sovereignty of Egypt. Intrigues failing of success he
openly threw off his allegiance to the sultan, and attacked
Cairo, capturing the fortress. This threw Alexandria and
the coast into his power, and he proclaimed himself sultan.<a name="FNanchor_64_64" id="FNanchor_64_64"></a><a href="#Footnote_64_64" class="fnanchor">64</a></p>

<p>This revolt of Ahmed Pasha has all the features of the
typical revolt against Turkish authority: the sudden disgrace
of an official high in power, his banishment under the
name of change of office, a tampering with the loyalty of
the troops of the province (in this case the Mamelukes), a
conflict with the loyal janissaries, sudden success, betrayal,
a rapid fall and a sudden punishment, ending in the triumph
of absolutism. The same story with change of names
is told a hundred times in Turkish chronicles. The only
way in which Suleiman differed from most of the sultans
under such circumstances was that he recognized the need
of a reorganization of the revolted province and sent the
grand vizir to effect it.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">44</a></span></p>
<p>Four months after his marriage Ibrahim Pasha was sent
to Egypt with a fleet and an army to settle the new governor
in Cairo and to reëstablish the former legislation of the
country.<a name="FNanchor_65_65" id="FNanchor_65_65"></a><a href="#Footnote_65_65" class="fnanchor">65</a> The Turkish historians<a name="FNanchor_66_66" id="FNanchor_66_66"></a><a href="#Footnote_66_66" class="fnanchor">66</a> give much space to the
splendid state in which Ibrahim left the Porte and the unparalleled
honor paid him by the company of Sultan Suleiman
as far as the Princes Isles, and also to the difficulties
of the voyage, interrupted several times by storms. The
last part of the journey was made overland, Ibrahim visiting
Aleppo and Damascus, where he put the terror of the
sultan into the beylerbeys, who had been forgetting all but
their own interests. Throughout the journey, the grand
vizir received complaints and rendered justice, earning the
blessings of the people whom he visited.<a name="FNanchor_67_67" id="FNanchor_67_67"></a><a href="#Footnote_67_67" class="fnanchor">67</a></p>

<p>The arrival of the imperial mission in Cairo was marked
by great ceremony, the Mamelukes showing themselves as
splendid in all their appointments as were the Ottomans.
“All the people of Egypt came to meet Ibrahim Pasha,”
declares Solakzadeh, “each one according to his rank being
garbed in a robe of honor, and from the forts guns
sounded, and fêtes and rejoicings were held.”</p>

<p>Ibrahim Pasha spent three months in Egypt, actively en<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">45</a></span>gaged
in improving the condition of that province, which
he found “ailing, but amenable to the skill and zeal of a
clever doctor.”<a name="FNanchor_68_68" id="FNanchor_68_68"></a><a href="#Footnote_68_68" class="fnanchor">68</a> The first move was to punish those who
had assisted Ahmed Pasha in his treachery, several Arab
chiefs being publicly hanged, so that the Arab people “began
to weep for fear.”<a name="FNanchor_69_69" id="FNanchor_69_69"></a><a href="#Footnote_69_69" class="fnanchor">69</a> Ibrahim next relieved many individuals
who suffered under injustice, receiving in person
crowds of petitioners, and relieving as many as possible.
Among these acts of mercy were the release of 300 debtors
from prison and the satisfaction of their creditors.<a name="FNanchor_70_70" id="FNanchor_70_70"></a><a href="#Footnote_70_70" class="fnanchor">70</a> He
improved the appearance of Cairo by restoring several buildings
that had fallen into disrepair, particularly mosques and
schools, and also built some new ones at his own expense.
To erect such buildings has always been considered an
act of piety, so that sultans, vizirs, and even the favorites
of sultans have acquired merit in this fashion, as the
numerous mosques and religious foundations of Turkey
testify. Ibrahim was thus following the usual custom. He
further drew up some rules for education, and for the care
of orphans.<a name="FNanchor_71_71" id="FNanchor_71_71"></a><a href="#Footnote_71_71" class="fnanchor">71</a> But the two main accomplishments of Ibrahim’s
sojourn in Egypt were the reëstablishment of the law
and the placing of the treasury on a better basis. Ahmed
Pasha, and probably several of his predecessors, had ignored
and weakened the law of the land, which Ibrahim undertook
to restore. He enforced the local laws and also some
of the general Koranic laws which had been neglected; but
he seems to have moderated and lightened them to suit the
needs and desires of the people, “for” says Solakzadeh,
uttering a sentiment so un‐Turkish that one is inclined to at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">46</a></span>tribute
it to the Greek vizir rather than to the Ottoman
chronicler, “the best things are the golden mean.” He
further states that the ideal striven for was uniform rule
for all the inhabitants of Egypt.<a name="FNanchor_72_72" id="FNanchor_72_72"></a><a href="#Footnote_72_72" class="fnanchor">72</a></p>

<p>The province was a rich one even before the days of great
dams, and one of the most important of the grand vizir’s
duties was to see that the taxes were properly gathered and
placed in the treasury at Cairo, and that a suitable tribute
was sent annually to the Porte. Ibrahim built two great
towers to contain the treasure. With Ibrahim Pasha on
this expedition was the Imperial defterdar or treasurer,
Iskender Chelebi, who calculated that Egypt could pay annually
80,000 ducats to the Porte, after deducting the cost
of administration.<a name="FNanchor_73_73" id="FNanchor_73_73"></a><a href="#Footnote_73_73" class="fnanchor">73</a> Ibrahim’s final act in Egypt was to
appoint Suleiman Pasha, the Beylerbey of Damascus to the
office of governor of Egypt. He seems to have chosen this
man for his economical disposition, for Solakzadeh says
“he watched, and shut his eyes to those who desired to spend
money, and then appointed Suleiman Pasha.”</p>

<p>Called back to the Porte by a <em>Hatt‐i‐humayoún</em>, he left
Egypt with her revolt quieted, her mutineers punished, her
oppressed temporarily relieved, her city improved, her law
reëstablished, and her finances arranged quite satisfactorily
to the Porte, if not to herself. Ibrahim showed himself
clear, forceful, just and merciful, if not a great constructive
statesman. He took back to Stamboul a large sum in gold
for the Imperial treasury, and was received by Suleiman
with great honor.<a name="FNanchor_74_74" id="FNanchor_74_74"></a><a href="#Footnote_74_74" class="fnanchor">74</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">47</a></span></p>

<p>The recall of Ibrahim Pasha was induced by an insurrection
of the janissaries who were tired of inactivity, and
showed their restlessness by pillaging the houses of the
absent grand vizir and defterdar, and several rich institutions.
Suleiman promptly executed several of the most audacious
leaders, then sent for Ibrahim Pasha to come and
deal with the situation. Clothing himself in mourning
garments, Ibrahim hastened back to the capital. On the
way he executed a number of Persian prisoners in Gallipoli,
for the Sultan had determined to quiet the janissaries by
the only effective means, namely to offer them a chance for
fighting and loot by making war against the most convenient
enemy, which in this case was Persia.</p>

<p>Of the war we speak elsewhere. Suffice it to say that
from this time on, Ibrahim was so occupied in war and
diplomacy that his administrative functions must have been
delegated largely to lower officials. His power, notwithstanding,
was very great, as will be seen from the <em>berat</em> of
investiture bestowed on him by the Sultan before the campaign
of Vienna, which is substantially as follows:</p>

<p>“I command Ibrahim Pasha to be from today and forever
my grand vizir and the serasker (chief of the army)
named by my Majesty in all my estates. My vizirs, beylerbeys,
judges of the army, legists, judges, seids, sheiks,
my dignitaries of the court and pillars of the empire, sandjakbeys,
generals of cavalry or infantry, ... all my victorious
army, all my slaves, high or low, my functionaries
and employees, the people of my kingdom, my provinces,
the citizens and the peasants, the rich and the poor, in short
all shall recognize the above‐mentioned grand vizir as serasker,
and shall esteem and venerate him in this capacity,
regarding all that he says or believes as an order proceeding
from my mouth which rains pearls. Everyone shall
listen to his word with all possible attention, shall receive<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">48</a></span>
each of his recommendations with respect, and shall not
neglect any of them. The right of nomination and degradation
for the posts of beylerbeys and all other dignitaries
and functionaries, from highest to lowest, either at my
Blessed Porte or in the provinces, is confined to his sane
judgment, his penetrating intellect. Thus he must fulfil the
duties which the offices of grand vizir and serasker impose
on him, assigning to each man his suitable rank. When
my sublime person enters on a campaign, or when circumstances
demand the sending of an army, the serasker remains
sole master and judge of his actions, no one dare refuse
him obedience, and the dispositions which he judges
best to make relative to the collections in the sandjaks,
the fiefs and the employments, to the increase of wages or
salaries, to the distribution of presents, except such as are
made to the army in general, are in advance sanctioned and
approved by my Majesty. If against my sublime order
and the fundamental law a member of my army (which
Allah forbid!) rebel against the order of my grand vizir and
serasker; if one of my slaves oppress the people, let my
Sublime Porte be immediately informed, and the guilty,
whatever be their number, shall receive the punishment
which they shall merit.”<a name="FNanchor_75_75" id="FNanchor_75_75"></a><a href="#Footnote_75_75" class="fnanchor">75</a></p>

<p>This amazing gift of power brings out some characteristics
of the Ottoman state. There is no state, as such, apart
from the army. All the civil offices have military names,
and generally include military duties. It has often been
said that the Turkish empire is an army encamped in
Europe, an epigram that conveys much truth. The church,
the state, and the army are one and the sultan is the head
of the trinity.<a name="FNanchor_76_76" id="FNanchor_76_76"></a><a href="#Footnote_76_76" class="fnanchor">76</a> To Ibrahim were delegated full powers as
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">49</a></span>general and administrator, but he had no sacerdotal power
except such as was involved in the general power of appointment
and supervision. It follows that he did not
appoint the sheik‐ul‐Islam, and had no special dealings with
ulema.<a name="FNanchor_77_77" id="FNanchor_77_77"></a><a href="#Footnote_77_77" class="fnanchor">77</a> But curiously enough one of the few events of
his administration of which we have an account is connected
with religious interests. It is the Cabyz affair.</p>

<p>Cabyz was a member of the body of ulema, or interpreters
of the sacred law, who became convinced of the superiority
of Jesus to Mohammad, hence was a traitor both to Allah
and to the sultan. “He fell in to the valley of error and
took the route of destruction and danger, deviating from
the glorious path of truth.”<a name="FNanchor_78_78" id="FNanchor_78_78"></a><a href="#Footnote_78_78" class="fnanchor">78</a> Haled before the judges of
the army, Cabyz was summarily condemned to death, with
no attempt to convince him of his error. The grand vizir
reproved them for this unsuitable treatment of a heretic,
saying that the only arms against heresy should be law
and doctrine. The affair being therefore laid before the
divan, the sultan who was present behind his little window
was dissatisfied with the clemency of Ibrahim, perhaps because
the latter was Christian born, although now a zealous
Moslem.</p>

<p>“How is this” he demanded, “an irreligious infidel dares
to ascribe deficiency to the Blessed Prophet, and he goes
without being convinced of his error or punished?” Ibrahim
claimed that the judges lacked the knowledge of the sacred
law necessary to deal with the case. So the judge of Stamboul
and the Mufti were called in and after a long discussion
Cabyz’ “tongue was stopped and he lowered his head.”
Cabyz was condemned by the sacred law and executed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">50</a></span></p>

<p>This case in which a heretic was first brought before the
judges of the army and then before the council of state before
he was finally condemned by the religious law, shows
the awkward working of a state whose functions were so
slightly differentiated. Perhaps the easiest way to think of
the grand vizir is as the <em>alter ego</em> of the sultan, as he has
been called.<a name="FNanchor_79_79" id="FNanchor_79_79"></a><a href="#Footnote_79_79" class="fnanchor">79</a></p>

<p>For details of Ibrahim’s official work we have a bit here
and a bit there, but no general account. He seems to
have been zealous in the cause of commerce, out of which
he made a considerable profit. He established a monopoly
of Syrian commerce afterwards taken over by the sultan,<a name="FNanchor_80_80" id="FNanchor_80_80"></a><a href="#Footnote_80_80" class="fnanchor">80</a>
and caused all the trade of that country to pass through Constantinople.<a name="FNanchor_81_81" id="FNanchor_81_81"></a><a href="#Footnote_81_81" class="fnanchor">81</a>
He encouraged trade with Venice, freeing
that country from payment of duty on merchandize brought
from Syria.<a name="FNanchor_82_82" id="FNanchor_82_82"></a><a href="#Footnote_82_82" class="fnanchor">82</a> He was always a friend to Venice, helping
her trade and keeping the Porte from war with her as long
as he lived.<a name="FNanchor_83_83" id="FNanchor_83_83"></a><a href="#Footnote_83_83" class="fnanchor">83</a></p>

<p>From the Venetian reports we see how general Ibrahim’s
interests were;<a name="FNanchor_84_84" id="FNanchor_84_84"></a><a href="#Footnote_84_84" class="fnanchor">84</a> now he is looking after the corn trade, now
receiving cargoes of biscuits, now concerning himself in
the building of a canal, now opening new trade routes, now
watching the coming of new vessels to the Porte. The trade
of the Dalmatian coast he encouraged. As beylerbey of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">51</a></span>Roumelie he would be most interested in the European trade
and other relations. The export and import trade of
Turkey was scarcely born in his day, although the Muscovy
and other trading companies were beginning to ask for
concessions in the Ottoman dominions. Ibrahim’s ideas on
this subject were not great nor especially in advance of his
time.</p>

<p>In his quality as judge, he settled disputes and arranged
wills to the apparent satisfaction of the interested parties.
Every envoy to the Porte, whether on state, commercial, or
personal business, was first presented to the grand vizir, who
might take complete charge of his affair, or he might refer
him to the sultan. The grand vizir received in great state
and the Venetian letters are full of advice as to how to conciliate
the great minister. There seems to be little disagreement
among his critics as to Ibrahim’s ability. He is pronounced
by all to be a wise and able man; but he had at
least one severe critic among the Venetians, who felt that
his power was too arbitrary. Daniello di Ludovisi in 1534
wrote thus:<a name="FNanchor_85_85" id="FNanchor_85_85"></a><a href="#Footnote_85_85" class="fnanchor">85</a></p>

<blockquote><p class="tb">Suleiman gave his administration of the empire into the
hands of another. The sultan, with all the pashas and all the
court, would conduct no important deliberation without Ibrahim
Pasha, while Ibrahim would do everything without Suleiman
or any other advisor. So the state lacked good council,
and the army good heads. Suleiman’s affection for Ibrahim
should not be praised, but blamed.</p></blockquote>

<p class="tb">And again:</p>

<blockquote><p class="tb">Another evil existed in the Turkish army, and was caused,
first, by the negligence of the sultan (who, to tell the truth, is
not of such ability as the greatness of the empire demands),
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">52</a></span>
and secondly, by the actions of Ibrahim Pasha, who by the
same means as those used to raise and maintain himself—namely,
to degrade, and even to kill, all whose ability aroused
his suspicion—deprived the state of men of good council and
the army of good captains.</p>

<p>For instance, he decapitated Ferad Pasha, a valiant captain,
and was the cause of the rebellion of Ahmed Pasha, who was
beheaded at Cairo, and he caused Piri Pasha to leave office, an
old man and an old councillor, and some even accused him of
causing his death by poison. And it followed, also, that Rustem,
a young fellow, master of the stables of the Grand Seigneur,
became familiar with the latter, and Ibrahim, warned of
this, and being then in Aleppo, sent him to be governor in Asia
Minor, a long distance away. Rustem, feeling very badly,
asked the Grand Seigneur not to let him go, who replied,
“When I see Ibrahim, I will see that he causes you to return
near me.” For this reason the army was without council except
Ibrahim alone, and men of learning and force, from fear
and suspicion, hid their knowledge and ability. So the army
was demoralized and enervated. I feel certain that Ibrahim
Pasha realized this (for he was a man of good parts, but not
of such merit as to find a remedy for such evils), but he loved
himself much more than he did his lord, and wished to be alone
in the dominion of the world in which he was much respected.</p></blockquote>

<p class="tb">This criticism of Ibrahim Pasha was later repeated in a
more general form by one Kogabey, who presented to Sultan
Mourad IV a memorial on the decadence of the Ottoman
state. The two first reasons that he assigned for the deterioration
were the sultan’s ceasing to preside over the divan in
person, and the placing of favorites in the office of grand
vizir, the latter custom having been started by Suleiman I,
who raised his favorite Ibrahim from the palace to the divan.
Such vizirs, Kogabey explained, had no insight into the circumstances
of the whole nation. They generally were
blinded by the splendor of their position and refused to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">53</a></span>
consult intelligent men on affairs of government, and so the
order of the state was destroyed through their carelessness.<a name="FNanchor_86_86" id="FNanchor_86_86"></a><a href="#Footnote_86_86" class="fnanchor">86</a></p>

<p>The custom of appointing favorites to the most important
office in the empire was certainly a bad one, but Ibrahim was
a more efficient administrator than could have been expected
from his training, and ranks among the great vizirs of the
Ottoman Empire.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER III<br /><br />

<small><span class="smcap">Ibrahim the Diplomat</span></small></h2>

<p><span class="smcap">We</span> must now turn from Turkey’s internal affairs to her
foreign relations. Turkish political history during the sixteenth
century was so interwoven with that of the European
states, the influence of Ottoman interference upon the wars
and negotiations of Christian princes was so marked, that
a study of Suleiman’s foreign relations becomes almost a
study of contemporary Europe.<a name="FNanchor_87_87" id="FNanchor_87_87"></a><a href="#Footnote_87_87" class="fnanchor">87</a> The two sultans who succeeded
Mohammed the Conqueror had not extended Turkish
power in Europe, Bayazid having failed in his attempts at
conquest, and Selim having turned his attention from Europe
to the East. This caused a period of transition and preparation
for the great events of Suleiman’s reign.</p>

<p>When Suleiman came to the throne, he found certain relations
established with Ragusa and Venice, the two commercial
cities of the Adriatic, whose large carrying trade
made an <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">entente cordiale</i> with the Porte very desirable.<a name="FNanchor_88_88" id="FNanchor_88_88"></a><a href="#Footnote_88_88" class="fnanchor">88</a>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">55</a></span>Ragusa was the first foreign state to reach the new sultan
with her congratulations on his accession,<a name="FNanchor_89_89" id="FNanchor_89_89"></a><a href="#Footnote_89_89" class="fnanchor">89</a> and the sultan
renewed with the Ragusan republic the commercial privileges
it had enjoyed in Egypt.</p>

<p>After Venice had been defeated by Turkey in the battle
of Sapienza in 1499 and had been obliged to sue for peace,
she had received the following answer from the then grand
vizir: “You can tell the doge that he has done wedding
the sea, it is our turn now.”<a name="FNanchor_90_90" id="FNanchor_90_90"></a><a href="#Footnote_90_90" class="fnanchor">90</a> This boast became steadily
more completely realized as Turkish conquest in the Mediterranean
continued, and Venice soon saw that her chance
of freedom on the seas lay in keeping on good terms
with the Turk, whom she could not conquer. In vain
she sought for help against the Moslems; in vain she carried
on a single‐handed struggle against their encroachments,
earning the title of “Bulwark of Christianity”.
Had she not “learned to kiss the hand that she could not
cut off,”<a name="FNanchor_91_91" id="FNanchor_91_91"></a><a href="#Footnote_91_91" class="fnanchor">91</a> she could not have continued to exist as even
the second‐rate power in the Levant to which she had been reduced.
Frequent missions were
sent from Venice to the Porte, and a Venetian baillie was
kept at the Porte. These baillies were very good statesmen,
and they not only kept Venice on good terms with Turkey
for thirty‐three years, but they made an invaluable contribution
to recorded history by sending frequent and detailed
reports to the signories.</p>

<p>Russia also sent an embassy to the Porte, after the conquests
of Belgrad and Rhodes had demonstrated the power
of Turkey; and the Tsar, recognizing the value of an alliance
with the Porte, made two attempts to form one, but
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">56</a></span>without success. Suleiman saw no advantage in such an
alliance, but he never assumed an unfriendly attitude towards
Russia, at that time still an unimportant power. In
a letter written later in his reign he recalls the amicable relations
that had existed between the Porte and Russia, and
recommends his Ottoman merchants to buy furs and merchandise
in Moscow.<a name="FNanchor_92_92" id="FNanchor_92_92"></a><a href="#Footnote_92_92" class="fnanchor">92</a></p>

<p>As Suleiman’s conquests naturally threw him into antagonism
with the House of Hapsburg, it is desirable to review
briefly the political conditions in the Holy Roman
Empire at this time.</p>

<p>The accession of Charles of Spain to the Imperial throne
took place in October of the same year as Suleiman’s accession,
1520. Handicapped in every possible way by the
German princes, for whose safety and prosperity the emperor
assumed the entire responsibility without receiving in
return any equivalent whatever,<a name="FNanchor_93_93" id="FNanchor_93_93"></a><a href="#Footnote_93_93" class="fnanchor">93</a> Charles V presented a
great contrast to Suleiman, whose slightest word was law
throughout his extensive dominions. With the empire,
Charles acquired the enmity of Francis I of France, his unsuccessful
rival, and hereafter his constant foe. Another
rival not outwardly so dangerous, but destined to be a great
source of anxiety and weakness to the empire was Ferdinand,
the emperor’s brother. Concerning him, Charles’
counsellor, de Chièvres, is reported to have said to Charles,<a name="FNanchor_94_94" id="FNanchor_94_94"></a><a href="#Footnote_94_94" class="fnanchor">94</a>
“Do not fear the king of France nor any other prince except
your brother”. Ferdinand’s ambition had been early
recognized. His grandfather, Ferdinand of Aragon, had
attempted to construct an Italian kingdom for him, but
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">57</a></span>failed. Charles, after his election to the Empire, tried to
satisfy Ferdinand’s craving for power by conferring on
him the old Austrian provinces, and further by marrying
him to Anna, heiress of the kingdom of Hungary and
Bohemia, whose child‐king, Lewis, was weak physically and
not destined for a long reign. This opened to Ferdinand a
large sphere of activity in the southeast, and brought him
into direct contact with the steadily encroaching Suleiman;
a sphere that effectually absorbed his energies and made
him but a source of weakness to the Empire.</p>

<p>Thus Charles V, in name the imperial ruler of Central
Europe, was confronted with four rivals who desired to
divide with him the supremacy; Francis I, a relentless foe;
his brother Ferdinand, an ambitious claimant: the conquering
Suleiman; and the Protestant Revolt. The weakness
and disunion of Christendom was the strength of Suleiman,
and he was far too shrewd not to trade on it.</p>

<p>It had in fact been long since Europe had been sufficiently
united to oppose with any vigor the oncoming Turks. The
Popes of Rome had been the most persistent foes of Turkish
advance in Europe; notably Calixtus III, who in 1453 tried
in vain to save Europe from Mohammed’s conquering
armies; Pius II, who having for his master—thought the
freeing of Europe from Islam, preached a general crusade,
and even attempted to convert Mohammed by letter;
Paul II, who gave lavish aid to Scanderbeg and the armies
in Hungary and Albania in their struggle against Turkish
invasion; Alexander VI, who held Prince Jem, the mutinous
brother of Sultan Bayazid, as hostage for the friendliness
of the sultan whom he attacked after Jem’s death; and
Julius II, who planned a crusade early in the sixteenth century,
but failed to execute it.<a name="FNanchor_95_95" id="FNanchor_95_95"></a><a href="#Footnote_95_95" class="fnanchor">95</a> All this time Turkish con<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">58</a></span>quest
continued practically unhindered. By the close of the
fifteenth century the Turks were accepted as a permanent
political factor in Europe. Nevertheless, when
Charles became a candidate for election to the headship of
the Holy Roman Empire, he emphasized his fitness for the
high office by alleging that his vast possessions, united to
the Imperial dignity, would enable him to oppose the Turks
successfully.<a name="FNanchor_96_96" id="FNanchor_96_96"></a><a href="#Footnote_96_96" class="fnanchor">96</a> But the sudden rise of revolt
within the Church tended to force the dread of Islam into
the background, even in the face of the loss of Belgrad and
Rhodes. At least such was the case with Charles V and the
German princes; it was of necessity otherwise with little
King Lewis, who saw with terror the preparations of the
Turkish conquerors for war to the death with Hungary.</p>

<p>As Suleiman’s conquests naturally threw him into antagonism
with Austria, equally naturally he had common interests
with Francis I. Friendly relations between the Porte
and France were not unprecedented, although strongly disapproved
by the more religious among the French. Commercial
agreements had existed for some time between the
two states.<a name="FNanchor_97_97" id="FNanchor_97_97"></a><a href="#Footnote_97_97" class="fnanchor">97</a> The accession of Francis I, January 1, 1515,
marked an epoch in the Eastern Question. Francis’ Oriental
policy began on the conventional lines; he made an
agreement with Leo X to drive the Turks from Europe but
refused to subsidize Hungary in the interests of this purpose.
The pope called for a truce in Europe and a crusade
against the common enemy, but the death of Maximilian
and the outbreak of the Protestant Revolt put a complete stop to
this plan. The only result was the extension of the circle
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">59</a></span>of European politics to include Eastern affairs and the
Ottoman Empire, and to bring the Eastern Question home
to all the European powers. Those who had been furthest
away were now drawn in; France, Spain, and even England
began to step within the circle of Eastern influence.</p>

<p>The battle of Pavia marked a crisis in European affairs.
The captivity of the French king, his falling into the hands
of his bitterest foe, Charles of Hapsburg, destroyed any
scruples that the French court had felt against seeking
Turkish aid. The first French mission to Suleiman I did
not reach the Porte, the ambassador being assassinated en
route.<a name="FNanchor_98_98" id="FNanchor_98_98"></a><a href="#Footnote_98_98" class="fnanchor">98</a> This first attempt was quickly followed by another.
The Croat Frangipani brought two letters to the Sultan, one
written by Francis from his Madrid prison, the other from
his distracted mother, the queen‐regent. Francis also sent
a letter to Ibrahim Pasha, who later gave an account of
this embassy to Cornelius Scepper and Hieronymus von
Zara, envoys of Ferdinand.<a name="FNanchor_99_99" id="FNanchor_99_99"></a><a href="#Footnote_99_99" class="fnanchor">99</a></p>

<p><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“Post hec tempora, inquit Ibrahim, accedit quod rex
Francie captus fuit. Tunc mater ipsius regis ad ipsum
Caesarem Thurcarum scripsit hoc modo. ‘Filius meus Rex
Francie captus est à Carolo, Rege Hispanie. Speravi quod
ipse liberaliter ipsum demitteret. Id quo non fecit, sed
iniuste cum eo agit. Confugimus ad te magnum Caesarem
ut tu liberalitatem tuam ostendas et filium meum redimas’.”</span><a name="FNanchor_100_100" id="FNanchor_100_100"></a><a href="#Footnote_100_100" class="fnanchor">100</a></p>

<p>Frangipani demanded that Suleiman should undertake an
expedition by land and sea to deliver the king of France, who
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">60</a></span>otherwise would make terms which would leave Charles
master of the world. This exactly fitted into the plans of
Suleiman, whose European expeditions were naturally directed
against the possessions of the house of Hapsburg; so
he graciously acceded to all the demands of the French
mission. Ibrahim later stated<a name="FNanchor_101_101" id="FNanchor_101_101"></a><a href="#Footnote_101_101" class="fnanchor">101</a> that this embassy decided
the Sultan to prepare his army immediately for an expedition
into Hungary. The knowledge of this successful embassy
was one of the reasons that led Charles to sign the
Treaty of Madrid in January, 1526. By the time of this
treaty Francis promised to send five thousand cavalry and
fifteen thousand infantry against his recent allies, the
Turks,—but of course he had no intention of keeping his
word.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">61</a></span></p>
<p>Since the capture of Belgrad by the Turks in 1521, hostilities
on the Hungarian frontier had never ceased, and the
Turkish danger had been constantly before the Reichstag
and in the mind of the Pope. In April, 1526, Suleiman started
with a large army for his first regular Hungarian campaign.
The Hungarian nobles, continually at feud with one another,
were utterly unprepared to resist him, and the treasury
was exhausted. The first city to be taken was Peterwardein,
which was stormed by Ibrahim Pasha. Then fell
Illok and Esek. But the decisive victory of the campaign
was the battle of Mohacz, August 29, 1526. In this brief
but bloody conflict little King Lewis fell, and the country
was laid open to the sultan. The keys of Buda, the capital of
Hungary, were handed over to him and he entered the city
on September 1st. In spite of the express prohibition of the
sultan, his soldiers accustomed to regard war as an opportunity
for rapine, burned two quarters of the city, including
the great church, while the akinji (scouts) burned
neighboring villages and slaughtered the peasants. Other
victories followed until at last the sultan, promising the
Hungarians that John Zapolya should be their king, withdrew
his army to Constantinople, carrying with him an
immense amount of booty.</p>

<p>The death at Mohacz of King Lewis without direct heirs
left the thrones of Hungary and Bohemia vacant. The
Archduke Ferdinand, as the husband of Lewis’ sister,
and recognized as Lewis’ successor by official acts of his
brother, the Emperor Charles, passed at the Diets of Worms
and Brussels on April 28, 1521, and March 18, 1522, was
the legal heir to the throne. But the sovereignty was
claimed also by John Zapolya, voivode of Transylvania, a
vigorous fighter and an unscrupulous politician. Both of
these claimants had themselves been recognized in Hun<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">62</a></span>gary
and crowned with the Iron Crown,<a name="FNanchor_102_102" id="FNanchor_102_102"></a><a href="#Footnote_102_102" class="fnanchor">102</a> and both of them
turned for substantial aid in support of their claims to
Suleiman, regardless of possible loss of independence.
Suleiman, as conqueror of the strongholds of Hungary, and
as a court of appeal for the rivals, considered himself to
have in his hand the disposition of the crown. He did
not want it himself. He had expressly declared that he invaded
Hungary to avenge insults, not to take the kingdom
from Lewis; but the death of the latter forced him to choose
between the two rival claimants. His word had been pledged
for the support of Zapolya, and his dislike of the Hapsburgs
and his friendship for the French king inclined him to
keep it.</p>

<p>Ferdinand and Zapolya both hastened to send embassies
to the Turks, Ferdinand taking the first step. He sent envoys
to Upper Bosnia and to Belgrad to ask the governors
to refuse aid to Zapolya, offering three to six thousand
ducats for their alliance.<a name="FNanchor_103_103" id="FNanchor_103_103"></a><a href="#Footnote_103_103" class="fnanchor">103</a> One of the governors died before
the embassy reached him, and from neither of them were
there any results from this mission.<a name="FNanchor_104_104" id="FNanchor_104_104"></a><a href="#Footnote_104_104" class="fnanchor">104</a> At the same time Ferdinand
attacked Zapolya, driving him from Ofen and back
towards Transylvania. Zapolya in distress despatched his
first mission to the Porte. His envoy, Hieronymus Laszky,
was empowered to effect a defensive and offensive alliance
with the sultan. The mission was successful, Suleiman accepting
Zapolya’s offer of devotion, and promising him
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">63</a></span>the crown of Hungary and the protection of the Porte
against his enemies.</p>

<p>Although the mission from Zapolya was kept as secret
as possible, it soon became known to Ferdinand, who dispatched
the embassy he had long planned, in the hope
of counteracting Zapolya’s move. One embassy failed to
reach Constantinople,<a name="FNanchor_105_105" id="FNanchor_105_105"></a><a href="#Footnote_105_105" class="fnanchor">105</a> and the first ambassadors from
the archduke of Austria to reach the Porte were John
Hobordonacz and Sigmund Weixelberger, in May, 1528.
They demanded the Kingship of Hungary for their master
Ferdinand, and the restoration to Hungary of all the places
taken by Suleiman. The sultan refused both of these demands
and in his turn offered to make peace on the payment
of tribute. The embassy accomplished nothing, its sequel
being the campaign in Hungary in 1529. Three days before
the final answer to Ferdinand, Suleiman had in full
divan delivered to Ibrahim a commission making him
serasker or general‐in‐chief of the expedition against the
Hapsburgs. The Peace of Cambrai in 1529 left the Austrians
free to fight the Turks.</p>

<p>In the meanwhile French diplomacy continued actively.
Francis I was disturbed by the result of the invasion of
Hungary which he had himself urged, for the kingdoms of
Hungary and Bohemia seemed now to be falling into the
hands of his enemies of Austria. More than ever he had
need of the Ottoman alliance, and he determined on an
alliance with Zapolya. He sent Rincon to the latter to form
an offensive and defensive alliance, claiming as his reward
the reversion of the kingdom of Hungary for his second
son, Henry, should Zapolya die without heirs.<a name="FNanchor_106_106" id="FNanchor_106_106"></a><a href="#Footnote_106_106" class="fnanchor">106</a> On the 20th
of September, 1528, Sultan Suleiman renewed a former act
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">64</a></span>called by old French historians “la trêve marchande,”<a name="FNanchor_107_107" id="FNanchor_107_107"></a><a href="#Footnote_107_107" class="fnanchor">107</a> giving
commercial privileges to the Catalonian and French
merchants in the Mediterranean, and placing all French factories,
consuls, and pilgrims, under the protection of the
Sublime Porte. The French were thus able to reappear
with confidence in the Levant, and were welcomed by the
Christians in the East. The pilgrimages to Jerusalem recommenced.
Even Francis expressed a desire to go to the
Holy Land and to visit en route “his dear patron and friend,
Suleiman.”<a name="FNanchor_108_108" id="FNanchor_108_108"></a><a href="#Footnote_108_108" class="fnanchor">108</a> A question concerning the Holy Places in
Palestine was also brought up by Francis at this time, which
is of very great significance, as it marks the beginning of
the train of developments that resulted in the conception of
the protection of Turkey’s Christian subjects by the European
Powers. Francis and Venice united in asking that a
certain church in Jerusalem, long before converted into a
mosque, be restored to the Christians.<a name="FNanchor_109_109" id="FNanchor_109_109"></a><a href="#Footnote_109_109" class="fnanchor">109</a> Ibrahim replied
that had the King of France demanded a province, the
Turks would not have refused him, but in a matter of religion
they could not gratify his desire. Nevertheless the
Sultan made the following general promise which was later
used as a basis for further demand by the Catholics. He
wrote to Francis:<a name="FNanchor_110_110" id="FNanchor_110_110"></a><a href="#Footnote_110_110" class="fnanchor">110</a> “The Christians shall live peaceably
under the wing of our protection; they shall be allowed to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">65</a></span>repair their doors and windows; they shall preserve in all
safety their oratories and establishments which they actually
occupy, without any one being allowed to oppose or torment
them.”<a name="FNanchor_111_111" id="FNanchor_111_111"></a><a href="#Footnote_111_111" class="fnanchor">111</a></p>

<p>On the 10th day of May, 1529, Suleiman set out to settle
matters by force with Charles V. Before the end of August
the Turks were again encamped with a vast army on the
fatal plain of Mohacz. Here John Zapolya met his overlord
and did him homage. Three days later the Turks advanced
to Buda, and took it from Ferdinand, crowning
Zapolya a second time within the walls of the capital. By
September 27, Suleiman was encamped before Vienna.</p>

<p>On the 19th day of October, 1529, Ferdinand, in great
distress, wrote to his brother the Emperor; after referring
to the horrors that followed the siege of Vienna, he says:
“I do not know what he (Suleiman) intends to do,
whether to betake himself to his own country or to stay
in Hungary and fortify it and the fortresses, with the intention
of returning next spring to invade Christendom,
which I firmly believe he will do. I therefore beg you
Sire, to consider my great need and poverty, and that it
may please you not to abandon me but to assist me with
money.”<a name="FNanchor_112_112" id="FNanchor_112_112"></a><a href="#Footnote_112_112" class="fnanchor">112</a></p>

<p>The invasion of Austria had convinced Charles that he
must support Ferdinand against Turkey, and the royal
brothers agreed on their Oriental policy, namely, peace at
almost any price. To this end another embassy was fitted
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">66</a></span>out and despatched to treat with Suleiman. On the 17th
day of October, 1530, Nicholas Juritschitz and Joseph von
Lamberg arrived in Constantinople. Their instructions
were practically the same as those given Juritschitz the previous
year.<a name="FNanchor_113_113" id="FNanchor_113_113"></a><a href="#Footnote_113_113" class="fnanchor">113</a> The mission was hopeless from the start, for
the ambassadors could accept peace only on the condition of
the evacuation of Hungary by the Turks, and to this the
Sultan would not listen.</p>

<p>Ferdinand however, who had just failed in a military attack
on Zapolya and had accepted a truce, saw no hope but
in another embassy to the Porte. Therefore he sent Graf
Leonhard von Nogarola and Joseph von Lamberg, who were
to attempt to buy peace by the payment of annual pensions
to Suleiman and Ibrahim. The sultan, who had already left
Constantinople at the head of a great army for his fifth
Hungarian campaign, was intercepted at his camp near Belgrad
by the Austrian envoys. The only result of this embassy
was a letter to Ferdinand from Suleiman saying that
the latter was starting for Ofen, where he would treat with
Ferdinand in person, a threat which he followed up immediately.</p>

<p>By April, 1531, Suleiman was ready to avenge his failure
before Vienna. At Belgrad he was met by the French
ambassador Rincon. France was now anxious to prevent
the Sultan’s expedition against Austria, not in the interests
of the Hapsburgs but against them, for he was afraid that
the Turkish danger would unite Catholic and Protestant Germany
against the common foe of Christianity. Suleiman
received Rincon hospitably but assured him he had come too
late, for while on account of his friendship with the King of
France he would like to oblige the latter, he could not give
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">67</a></span>up the expedition without giving the world occasion to think
that he was afraid of the “King of Spain”, as he always
called Charles V.<a name="FNanchor_114_114" id="FNanchor_114_114"></a><a href="#Footnote_114_114" class="fnanchor">114</a></p>

<p>The Ottoman army entered Hungary. Fourteen fortresses
sent the Sultan their keys as he approached.<a name="FNanchor_115_115" id="FNanchor_115_115"></a><a href="#Footnote_115_115" class="fnanchor">115</a> But
the forces did not advance to Vienna as their enemies expected,
but turned into Styria and besieged the little town
of Güns. For three weeks seven hundred brave defenders
held the little fort against the might of Turkish arms, and
finally made a highly honorable capitulation. After a
general devastation of the country and much looting, the
great army of Suleiman returned to Constantinople. Suleiman
was incited to this course by the active preparations
which were being made by Charles and Ferdinand to receive
him at Vienna, and by the naval successes in the Mediterranean
of Andrea Doria, admiral of the Italian fleet.
Thus what promised to be a great duel between the two
“Masters of the World” was allowed by both of them to
degenerate into a plundering expedition.</p>

<p>Affairs in Persia were in great need of Suleiman’s presence,
and the capture of Koron and Patras by Doria made
the Sultan more ready to listen to overtures of peace.
Charles and Ferdinand took advantage of this fact to send
Hieronymus von Zara and Cornelius Duplicius Schepper to
the Porte in 1533. The ambassadors, after weeks of patience
and adroitness succeeded in winning from the Sultan
a treaty of peace, to last as long as Ferdinand should remain
peaceful. Ferdinand was to retain the forts he had
taken in Hungary and Zapolya to keep the others; the
Emperor Charles might make peace by sending his own
embassy to the Porte. As soon as Ferdinand received the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">68</a></span>news of this humiliating success, he sent word all over the
kingdom, to Carniola, Croatia, Dalmatia and Slavonia that
any violation of the truce would be severely punished; “denn
daran ... mug der Turghisch Kaeser erkhennen dass wir den
Frieden angenommen derselben zu halten gaentzlich entschlossen
und so dawider gehandelt wurf, dass mit ernst zu
shafen willen haben.”<a name="FNanchor_116_116" id="FNanchor_116_116"></a><a href="#Footnote_116_116" class="fnanchor">116</a> Such were the humiliating terms
of the first peace concluded by the House of Austria with
the Porte (1533).</p>

<p>Shortly after the embassy of von Zara and Schepper,
Suleiman left Europe to wage war against the Persians. As
usual when planning a campaign in one direction, he made
careful arrangements to keep matters quiet on other frontiers.
He treated in secret with Francis I, agreeing to
despatch Barbarosa with a fleet to ravage the coasts of the
Empire; this was a great success for French diplomacy, for
the advantage was all in favor of France. Then, fearing lest
the rivals for the Hungarian throne should come to an
agreement in his absence, and thus menace his suzerainty,
Suleiman delegated Luigi Gritti to determine the frontiers
between the possessions of the two kings. This was a clever
move, for it prolonged the intrigues between the royal competitors
until the return of the sultan. The successes of Barbarosa,
the victories and defeats of Charles V on the Mediterranean,
and the continuation of French diplomacy are
outside the limits of our subject, which ends with the death
of Ibrahim Pasha in 1535. Gévay preserves several letters
written by Ferdinand to Ibrahim in 1535–6, in the interest of
peace in Hungary, the last being dated March 14, 1536, a
year after Ibrahim’s death. The last international act in
which Ibrahim Pasha had a part was the celebrated treaty
of commerce made with France in February, 1535.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">69</a></span></p>
<p>Francis I had received a Turkish mission, not from the
haughty Sultan, but from his admiral Barbarosa,<a name="FNanchor_117_117" id="FNanchor_117_117"></a><a href="#Footnote_117_117" class="fnanchor">117</a> and in
return the king sent a clever diplomat named La Forest, to
thank Barbarosa for his kind offers of aid, and then to
seek the sultan in Persia and conclude a definite treaty with
him.<a name="FNanchor_118_118" id="FNanchor_118_118"></a><a href="#Footnote_118_118" class="fnanchor">118</a> Suleiman received La Forest in his military camp,
keeping him till his own return to Turkey in 1535.</p>

<p>The treaty is dated February, 1535; it formed the basis of
the economic, religious, and political protectorate of France
in the Levant. The French might carry on commerce
in the Levant by paying the same dues as did the subjects
of the Sultan, and the Turks could do the same in France.
The French were to be judged by their consul at Alexandria
or by their ambassador at Constantinople. This treaty
ended the commercial predominance of Venice in the Mediterranean.
After this, all Christians except the Venetians
were forced to put themselves under the protection of the
French flag, which alone guaranteed inviolability.<a name="FNanchor_119_119" id="FNanchor_119_119"></a><a href="#Footnote_119_119" class="fnanchor">119</a> This
commercial freedom and political influence gained by
France involved a sort of economic protection and was
supplemented by a religious protectorate over the Catholics
in the Levant and the Holy Places.</p>

<p>After this sketch of the beginnings of diplomatic relations
between the Porte and the two rival powers of Europe,
the House of Hapsburg and the House of Valois, we are
ready to consider the significance of these relations and to
take up some of the details that will serve to bring out the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">70</a></span>share of Ibrahim Pasha in Turkish diplomacy, and his
characteristics as a diplomat.</p>

<p>Diplomatic relations between the Porte and Europe, relations
other than those of conqueror and conquered, relations
reciprocal and more or less friendly, began in the reign of
Suleiman I, and the first French embassy to the Porte in
1526 already described was the beginning of a complete
change in the European attitude towards Turkey. Before
this time, the religious differences between Moslem and
Christian had effectually absorbed attention, but now political
interests began to push aside religious concern. The
masses of the people in Europe still feared a Moslem invasion
of the North, but this was no longer a real danger.
A general rising of Christians, such as a crusade, was no
longer necessary to hold back the Turk; the regular means
and the ordinary efforts of a few states combined sufficed, as
was proved by the successful resistance of Güns and Vienna.
It was decreed that the Turk was not to pass Vienna.
Francis might therefore seek the friendship of the Ottoman
without betraying the cause of Christianity. There
were, it is true, plenty of Christians who cried out against
the impious alliance of the Crescent and the Lily,<a name="FNanchor_120_120" id="FNanchor_120_120"></a><a href="#Footnote_120_120" class="fnanchor">120</a> but the
outcry was largely political and as we have seen soon even
the Austrians were seeking terms of peace with the Turks.</p>

<p>When Suleiman came to the throne, he attended closely
to the business of government, but by 1526 he was leaving
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">71</a></span>practically the whole responsibility on the shoulders of his
grand vizir Ibrahim. Ambassadors to the Porte had their
first audience always with Ibrahim, after which they sometimes
had audiences with the other vizirs. Generally a very
formal ceremony of hand‐kissing was permitted by the
Sultan, after which Ibrahim concluded the business. At
some audiences with the grand vizir, Suleiman would be
present, concealed behind a little window,<a name="FNanchor_121_121" id="FNanchor_121_121"></a><a href="#Footnote_121_121" class="fnanchor">121</a> but oftener he
was not present at all.</p>

<p>In his early diplomatic work, Ibrahim, feeling himself
unprepared, turned to Luigi Gritti, natural son by a Greek
mother of Andreas Gritti, who had been ambassador and
at one time doge of Venice. Ibrahim was very well
served by Luigi Gritti, who was intelligent as well as experienced,
especially in Christian dealings, clever, able, and
tactful.<a name="FNanchor_122_122" id="FNanchor_122_122"></a><a href="#Footnote_122_122" class="fnanchor">122</a> Zapolya’s ambassador Laszky, knowing this, persuaded
Gritti to take up his affairs, hoping through him to
win Ibrahim, and through Ibrahim, Suleiman. The event
justified him.<a name="FNanchor_123_123" id="FNanchor_123_123"></a><a href="#Footnote_123_123" class="fnanchor">123</a> Ibrahim frankly acknowledged Gritti’s influence,
saying to Laszky: “Without the Doge Gritti and
his son we should have destroyed the power of Ferdinand
and of thy master (Zapolya), for the conflict of two enemies
who ruin each other is always favorable to the third who
survives.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">72</a></span></p>

<p>We may get an idea of the manner of conducting embassies
at the Porte, as well as the functions and characteristics
of Ibrahim as diplomat as such by following the report
of Hobordanacz to Ferdinand. Hobordanacz sent an
official and detailed report of the embassy to his master,
written in Latin, which is preserved in Gévay’s <i lang="de" xml:lang="de">Urkunden
und Actenstuecke</i>.<a name="FNanchor_124_124" id="FNanchor_124_124"></a><a href="#Footnote_124_124" class="fnanchor">124</a></p>

<p>The two ambassadors Hobordanacz and Weixelberger
were received with splendor on their entrance into Constantinople
by a guard of four hundred knights, and were immediately
conducted to the grand vizir. This ceremonious
reception greatly encouraged the hopes of Hobordanacz.<a name="FNanchor_125_125" id="FNanchor_125_125"></a><a href="#Footnote_125_125" class="fnanchor">125</a>
After greetings to Ibrahim, “Supremum Nomine”, the
Hungarians offered him presents and then retired to quarters
assigned them. On the third day forty horsemen escorted
the royal nuncios to the Imperial palace. Hobordanacz
was greatly impressed with the splendid array of janissaries
and guards in gorgeous costumes. They were received by
the three vizirs, Ibrahim, Cassim, and Ayas Pasha, while
from his little window his Majesty watched the audience,
himself unseen.</p>

<p>Amidst profound silence, Ibrahim Pasha addressed the
first nuncio, asking him politely whether they were treated
well in their quarters, to which Hobordanacz answered that
they had everything in abundance, as was fitting in the
palace of so great an emperor. Ibrahim then began to interrogate
them concerning the journey and their king, ex<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">73</a></span>plaining
that he was not asking about the king of Hungary,
for Lewis of Hungary had been killed in battle, but was
inquiring about the king of Bohemia and Germany. The
Hungarian nuncios took the opportunity to boast of the
greatness of Ferdinand, provoking a smile from Ibrahim.
Hobordanacz said they had come to admire and to congratulate
the emperor of the Turks that God had made him
a nearer neighbor to Ferdinand than previously. He said
that the Emperor Maximilian had given Hungary to Ferdinand,
whereupon Ibrahim broke in: “By what right, when
Sultan Suleiman has subjugated Hungary?” He asked
them if they did not know that the Sultan had been to Buda.
The Hungarians responded rudely that there were signs
enough by which they could know of Suleiman’s visit, as the
country lay waste. Ibrahim went on: “The fortress of
Buda, how does it stand?” “Whole and undamaged,” they
replied. When he asked why, they suggested that it was
because it was the king’s castle. Ibrahim denied this and
said it was because the sultan had saved the citadel for himself,
and intended to keep it with divine aid. Ibrahim here
explained that Suleiman and he had not wished so much
harm done in Hungary, and had ordered the soldiers not
to burn Buda and Pesth, but could not hold them back from
devastating. This was naturally a sore subject with the
Hungarians who after expressions of admiration for the
great obedience they saw in Turkey, even when the sultan
was not present, asked pertinently why then he could not
have saved Buda and Pesth. This seems to have been too
much for Ibrahim who remarked “Let us omit these things.”
Turning therefore to a more congenial subject, he uttered
a Turkish dictum, “Wherever the hoof of the sultan’s horse
has trod, there the land belongs to him.” Hobordanacz
replied somewhat sarcastically that they knew such was the
sultan’s idea, but that even Alexander the Great had not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">74</a></span>
been able to carry out all his ideas. Cutting through all
these generalities, Ibrahim said sharply, “Then you say that
Buda does not belong to Suleiman!” Hobordanacz replied
stoutly, “I can say no more than that my king holds Buda.”
Said Ibrahim, “Why has he then sent you to ask for peace
and friendship if he holds Buda, which the sultan has conquered?”
The nuncio told a long story of Zapolyta’s usurpation
of the throne, and of Ferdinand’s merits to which
Ibrahim sarcastically remarked, “You have talked of the
many virtues of your lord! Very noble if they be true!”
He then asked Hobordanacz if he were a relative of Ferdinand’s
and how long he had served the Archduke. The
nuncio replied that he had served him since the latter became
king of Hungary. “Then,” said the pasha triumphantly,
“if you have served him so short a time, how do you
know he is so wise and virtuous and powerful?” A curious
contest of wits followed with no practical object.</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="indent padl2">Ibrahim: “Tell us what wisdom you see in Ferdinand
and how you know that he is wise.”</p>

<p class="indent padl2">Hobor.: “Because when he has won great victories, he
ascribes the glory to God.”</p>

<p class="indent padl2">I.: “What does wisdom seem to you to be like?”</p>

<p class="indent padl2">H.: “In our books and in yours, the beginning of wisdom
is said to be the fear of God.”</p>

<p class="indent padl2">I.: “True, but what other wisdom do you find in Ferdinand?”</p>

<p class="indent padl2">H.: “He works deliberately and with foresight and
taking of counsel; also he undertakes no affairs
that he cannot finish.”</p>

<p class="indent padl2">I.: “If he does this, he is praiseworthy. Now what
boldness and courage do you find in him?”</p></blockquote>

<p>Ibrahim’s next question as to the victories of Ferdinand
received a long and clever answer. Ibrahim further in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">75</a></span>quired
as to Ferdinand’s wealth. Hobordanacz claimed
endless treasure for his master. Ibrahim then asked, “What
have you to say about the power of your master?” Hobordanacz
claimed many powerful friends and neighbors, the
greatest being his brother Charles. Ibrahim inflicted one
of his battle‐axe strokes; “We know that these so‐called
friends and neighbors are his enemies.” The Hungarian
replied sententiously, “Unhappy is the king without rivals,
whom all favor.” Ibrahim at length stopped the discussion
of Ferdinand’s merits by saying, “If this be so, it is well.”
Then he asked whether they came in peace or in war, to
which Hobordanacz replied that Ferdinand wished friendship
from all his neighbors and enmity from none.</p>

<p>After this sprightly introduction, Ibrahim led the nuncios
in a brilliant procession to the presence of the sultan. Here
the janissaries received gifts for the sultan from the servants
of the ambassadors, and showed them to all in turn;
in the next room seven eunuchs took the gifts and spread
them out on tables. The three pashas first went to salute
Suleiman, leaving the nuncios before the door. Ibrahim
Pasha and Cassim Pasha then, holding them by their two
arms, led each of the nuncios in turn to salute the sultan,
who sat with his hands on his knees and looked them over.
When they had saluted him, they returned to their place
by the door where stood the interpreter. Hobordanacz
was greatly annoyed because the interpreter, familiar with
the flowery and courtly Oriental speech, embellished the
somewhat curt address of the Hungarian, but Ibrahim told
the interpreter to repeat exactly what the envoy said. After
this he asked Hobordanacz to state his business. After this
statement of Ferdinand’s wishes, Suleiman called Ibrahim
to him and whispered in his ear. Ibrahim then resumed
negotiations while Suleiman looked on.</p>

<p>Taking up his grievance against Ferdinand once again,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">76</a></span>
Ibrahim inquired how the latter, in addressing the Sultan,
dared declare himself so powerful when other princes were
content to commend themselves to Suleiman’s protection
and to offer him their services. To Hobordanacz’ question
who these princes were, Ibrahim named the rulers of
France, Poland, and Transylvania, the Pope and the Doge
of Venice, and added that these princes (except the voivode
of Transylvania) were the greatest in Europe. The Austrian
nuncios seemed to be impressed and indeed the statement
was a sufficiently startling one and was moreover borne out
by the facts. After that Hobordanacz spoke with greater
meekness, expressing his master’s desire for the friendship
of the sultan, if the latter were willing to grant it. “If
he is not willing,” said Ibrahim sharply, “what then?”
Hobordanacz, recovering his boldness, said haughtily, “Our
master forces no man’s friendship.” Ibrahim then dismissed
them with the parting fling that the sultan was occupied
with much more important business. They never
saw the sultan again. Ibrahim informed them that his
master was concerned with personal affairs, and that he
himself would conduct the whole business. This illustrates
the respective shares of Suleiman and Ibrahim in
the business of the state. Doubtless the sultan had a definite
policy of friendship to Zapolya and antagonism to
Ferdinand, but it appears certain that he allowed Ibrahim
Pasha to control entirely the details of diplomacy.</p>

<p>In later audiences with the grand vizir, Hobordanacz expressed
the hope that Ferdinand and Charles V and Sultan
Suleiman might become good friends and neighbors. Ibrahim
inquired scornfully how such a friendship could come
about! Hobordanacz declared that it was his mission to
offer friendship, and it seemed to him that Ibrahim’s influence
should be able to bring about advantages for both
sides. Ibrahim again urged him to indicate the method of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">77</a></span>
procedure, saying, “Your king has seized upon our kingdom,
and yet he asks for friendship; how can that be?”
The nuncio said he knew all things at the Porte were done
by Ibrahim’s will and authority; he believed that he could
serve their cause. Ibrahim then proposed peace on condition
that Ferdinand should abandon Hungary. Hobordanacz
on the other hand asked for a definite truce for a term
of years and requested the restitution to Ferdinand of those
portions of Hungary taken by Suleiman, giving a list of
twenty‐seven fortresses. This aroused Ibrahim’s bitter
wrath. “It is strange” said he “that your master does
not ask for Constantinople.” He tried to make the ambassadors
acknowledge that Ferdinand would attempt to take
these forts by force if they were not conceded to him.
“With what hope does he ask for these forts,” he further
inquired, “when he knows that the sultan took them with
great labor and much bloodshed?”</p>

<p>The question of compensation for these forts being opened,
Ibrahim exclaimed indignantly that the sultan was not so
poor that he would sell what his arms had won. Dramatically
opening a window he said “Do you see those Seven
Towers! they are filled with gold and treasure.”<a name="FNanchor_126_126" id="FNanchor_126_126"></a><a href="#Footnote_126_126" class="fnanchor">126</a> He
then turned to the question of skill in war, and after praising
the prowess of the Germans, he said, “You know the
arms of the Turks, how sharp they are, and how far they
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">78</a></span>have penetrated, for you have fled before them many times.”
Hobordanacz gave a qualified assent, but praised his master’s
warlike skill. Ibrahim finally broke in, “Then your master
wishes to keep those forts?” Hobordanacz suggested a
middle course, but the grand vizir said decisively: “There
is no other way but for your king to abandon Buda and
Hungary and then we will treat with him about Germany.”
Upon Hobordanacz’ refusal to consider such terms Ibrahim
stated, “I conquered Lewis and Hungary, and now I will
build the bridges of the Sultan, and prepare a way for his
Majesty into Germany.” He closed the interview by accusing
Ferdinand and Charles of not keeping faith and said
he would give the nuncios a final reply in three or four days.</p>

<p>The third audience was held in the palace, with Ibrahim
presiding, and Suleiman at his window, and was conducted
on similar lines to the other audiences. Ibrahim informed
the Hungarians that their master had just been defeated by
Zapolya with an army of thirty‐six thousand men, which
statement Hobordanacz took the liberty of doubting, saying
that if Zapolya added all the cocks and hens in Transylvania
to his army, he could not make up the number to thirty‐six
thousand. The nuncios and the grand vizir could not
agree on terms of alliance; to the Austrian demands, Ibrahim
impatiently exclaimed: “The Emperor Charles and
your master, what do they want more? to rule the whole
earth? Do they count themselves no less than the gods?”
Naturally nothing was accomplished by such recrimination,
and finally Suleiman ended the audience, dismissing the ambassadors
with the threat: “Your master has not yet felt our
friendship and neighborliness, but he shall soon feel it.
You can tell your master frankly that I myself with all
my forces will come to him to give Hungary in our person
the fortresses he demands. Inform him that he must
be ready to treat me well.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">79</a></span></p>

<p>So ended the mission of Ferdinand for peace. There had
been no possibility of success from the beginning. Suleiman
and Ibrahim were not to be won to friendship for
Ferdinand, and had they been, the rude, independent Hobordanacz
was not the man to gain Oriental favor. One feels
that Ibrahim enjoyed the opportunity to sharpen his claws
on an enemy, and to show Europeans his own power and
that of his master. The envoys must have been very uncomfortable,
and their discomforts were not yet at an end,
for a Venetian enemy of Ferdinand’s told Ibrahim that they
were not ambassadors but spies, and urged their detention
at the Porte. For five months they were kept in close confinement,
after which a long journey lay between them and
the anxious Archduke who had hoped so much from the
embassy.</p>

<p>This treatment of royal ambassadors as though they were
spies was not uncommon at the Porte. The King of Poland
had been forced to complain of the rough handling of his
envoys by Sultan Bayazid (Suleiman’s grandfather), saying
they were not only detained for months before they were
given audience, but were thrown into prison, and instead of
being lodged like the envoys of a king, who would naturally
feel that it accorded with his honor to send only the sons of
the noblest families to represent him, were treated as criminals,
and that promises made to such envoys were often
broken.<a name="FNanchor_127_127" id="FNanchor_127_127"></a><a href="#Footnote_127_127" class="fnanchor">127</a> Busbequius, himself an ambassador, who was detained
for months and sharply watched, recounted another
instance, that of Malvezzi, whom the Sultan held responsible
for the broken faith of his master Ferdinand, and threw
into prison when Ferdinand took Transylvania in 1551.<a name="FNanchor_128_128" id="FNanchor_128_128"></a><a href="#Footnote_128_128" class="fnanchor">128</a> It
was a Turkish maxim that ambassadors were responsible for
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">80</a></span>the word given by their masters, and that in their capacity
as hostages they must expiate its violation; moreover power
was often conceived to reside in an ambassador, who
therefore was kept in durance in the hope that he could be
brought to terms. Such treatment, however naïve and
unjust, is nevertheless an improvement on the reception by
Hungary of the ambassador sent to announce the accession
of Suleiman, whose nose and ears were slit. Further illustrations
of the way ambassadors were liable to be treated
in Europe were the assassination of Rincon, envoy of
France, connived at by Charles V, and the murder of Martinez,
a Spanish ambassador to the Porte, instigated by
Ferdinand.</p>

<p>Ibrahim’s usual way of opening an audience was to brow‐beat
the ambassador, and he indulged in frequent sarcasm
and scornful laughter. To the envoys of Ferdinand in
1532 he railed at Ferdinand and “his tricks” and gibed at
his faithlessness. “How is a man a king” he said “unless
he keeps his word?”<a name="FNanchor_129_129" id="FNanchor_129_129"></a><a href="#Footnote_129_129" class="fnanchor">129</a> To Lamberg and Juritschitz (1530)<a name="FNanchor_130_130" id="FNanchor_130_130"></a><a href="#Footnote_130_130" class="fnanchor">130</a>
he spoke of the quarrels among Christian rulers, twitting
his auditors with Charles’s treatment of the Pope and of
Francis I, declaring that the Turks would never do “so inhuman
a thing,” and following this by a long talk “full of
scorn and irony.”<a name="FNanchor_131_131" id="FNanchor_131_131"></a><a href="#Footnote_131_131" class="fnanchor">131</a></p>

<p>Ibrahim was enormously inquisitive, seeming to look upon
a foreign embassy as an opportunity for gaining all sorts of
general information. Sometimes he asked about such practical
matters as the fortification of certain forts; at other
times he asked such trivial questions as how old the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">81</a></span>rulers were, and how they pronounced their names. He
once remarked that a man who did not try to learn all
things is an incompetent man. Several times he boasted
that in Turkey they knew all that was taking place in
Europe.</p>

<p>His manner, as we have seen, was usually sharp and rude,
but he could be elaborately courteous when he wished to
please, as when he received an embassy from “our good
friend” Francis I, and the Hungarian embassy of 1534.
He was invariably boastful; during the earlier years he
bragged of the sultan, his power and treasure; in the later
embassies he boasted of himself.</p>

<p>One of the most important documents about Ibrahim that
we possess is the account of the peace embassy sent by Ferdinand
in 1533, the report being written by Hieronymus
von Zara in Latin in September, 1533. This shows Ibrahim
in a sharper light than we have had elsewhere, and brings
out some traits in his character that have been growing
steadily since his rise to such great power: his ambition
and his towering pride.<a name="FNanchor_132_132" id="FNanchor_132_132"></a><a href="#Footnote_132_132" class="fnanchor">132</a></p>

<p>Ibrahim, splendidly clad, received the ambassadors for
their first audience, without rising. He accepted the rich
jewels they offered him, and appointed a later day for the
business of the treaty. On the appointed day the envoys
were permitted to kiss the garments of the grand vizir, and
they saluted him as brother of their sovereigns, Ferdinand
and Queen Marie of Hungary. Ibrahim had never acknowledged
the sovereignty of Ferdinand, and had always spoken
of him without any kingly title, to the amaze of the ambassadors.<a name="FNanchor_133_133" id="FNanchor_133_133"></a><a href="#Footnote_133_133" class="fnanchor">133</a>
In this interview and throughout the whole
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">82</a></span>conference Ibrahim spoke of Ferdinand as his brother, and
as son to Suleiman. This was not mere personal vanity;
under the pretext of the community of good which should
exist between father and son he cloaked the Sultan’s usurpation
of Hungary, and the fraternity of Ferdinand and
Ibrahim served to disguise the humiliation of the former,
who was placed in the same rank as a vizir.<a name="FNanchor_134_134" id="FNanchor_134_134"></a><a href="#Footnote_134_134" class="fnanchor">134</a> But in the
long speech that Ibrahim Pasha made to the ambassadors,
he revealed his personal pride. We quote from the speech:
“It is I who govern this vast empire. What I do is done;
I have all the power, all offices, all the rule. What I wish
to give is given and cannot be taken away; what I do not
give is not confirmed by any one. If ever the great Sultan
wishes to give, or has given anything, if I do not please it
is not carried out. All is in my hands, peace, war, treasure.
I do not say these things for no reason, but to give you
courage to speak freely.”<a name="FNanchor_135_135" id="FNanchor_135_135"></a><a href="#Footnote_135_135" class="fnanchor">135</a></p>

<p>When the letters of Emperor Charles were shown him,
he examined the seals, remarking as he did so: “My master
has two seals, of which one remains in his hands and the
other is confided to me, for he wishes no difference between
him and me; and if he has garments made for himself, he
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">83</a></span>orders the same for me; he refuses to let me expend anything
in building; this hall was built by him.”</p>

<p>Ibrahim seems to have lost his head during this, his last
embassy, and to have uttered things that were not safe
for any subject of an Oriental despot, however doting, to
utter. Whether he spoke out of the sheer madness that the
gods send upon those whom they would destroy, or whether
he seriously aspired to assume literally and explicitly the
power he held actually is impossible to say. Even as grand
vizir of Turkey he seems never to have forgotten that he was
a Greek. For years he ignored it, and behaved like a Turk
and a loyal Moslem, but as he came to feel more secure in
his high position, he became more careless, and spoke to
these Christian ambassadors of the pride and generosity
with which the Greeks are filled. It is a question whether
any Greek, from the fall of Byzantium to our time, has not
in his inmost heart felt his race superior to his Moslem
conquerors, and the fitting ruler of the Eastern Empire. To
that feeling are due some of the knottiest complexities in the
Young Turk situation of 1911. Naturally this attitude has
always been profoundly resented by the Turks; therefore
Ibrahim was seriously jeopardizing his standing with the
Ottoman Sultan when he remembered that he was both
Greek and Christian by birth.</p>

<p>There were plenty at the court to take immediate advantage
of any such slip. The courtiers had already been scandalized
at the freedom the Pasha took with the Sultan, and
thought that he had bewitched Suleiman.<a name="FNanchor_136_136" id="FNanchor_136_136"></a><a href="#Footnote_136_136" class="fnanchor">136</a> In the same
interview he further expresses his relations to his imperial
master in a parable:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">84</a></span></p>

<blockquote><p class="tb">The fiercest of animals, the lion, must be conquered not by
force, but by cleverness; by the food which his master gives it
and by the influence of habit. Its guardian should carry a
stick to intimidate it, and should be the only one to feed it. The
lion is the prince. The Emperor Charles is a lion. I, Ibrahim
Pasha, control my master, the Sultan of the Turks, with
the stick of truth and justice. Charles’ ambassador should
also control him in the same way.</p></blockquote>

<p class="tb">From this he went on to expatiate on his own power:</p>

<blockquote><p class="tb">The mighty Sultan of the Turks has given to me, Ibrahim,
all power and authority. It is I alone who do everything.
I am above all the pashas. I can elevate a groom to
a pasha. I give kingdoms and provinces to whom I will, without
inquiry even from my master. If he orders a thing and
I disapprove, it is not executed; but if I order a thing and he
disapproves, it is done nevertheless. To make war or conclude
peace is in my hands, and I can distribute all treasure.
My master’s kingdoms, lands, treasure, are confided to me.</p></blockquote>

<p class="tb">He also boasted of his past accomplishments, speaking
of himself as having conquered Hungary, received ambassadors,
and made peace. If Suleiman knew of these vauntings,
he made no sign of resentment, but continued to repose
the same confidence in Ibrahim as hitherto, but the
courtiers held them in their hearts to use when the time
should come.</p>

<p>Ibrahim’s importance and influence are taken for granted
by foreign rulers and envoys. In all his instructions to his
ambassadors Ferdinand tells them to see Ibrahim first, and
the queen regent of France wrote to him, when she wrote to
the sultan. The collections of Gévay and Charrière contain
a number of letters from Ferdinand and Francis to Ibrahim.
The Venetian baillies transacted all their business with
Ibrahim and sent many reports to the Signoria of his power<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">85</a></span>
in the state and his influence over the sultan. The envoys
brought him valuable presents which he did not hesitate to
accept.<a name="FNanchor_137_137" id="FNanchor_137_137"></a><a href="#Footnote_137_137" class="fnanchor">137</a> He loved to receive jewels and there was a famous
ruby once on the finger of Francis I which was sent
by the first French envoy to the Porte, (the envoy who was
killed in Bosnia) and which somehow came into Ibrahim’s
possession when the Pasha of Bosnia was called to Constantinople
to account for the murder.<a name="FNanchor_138_138" id="FNanchor_138_138"></a><a href="#Footnote_138_138" class="fnanchor">138</a></p>

<p>But although Ibrahim took presents, and even resented it
if they were not offered him, he refused bribes again and
again. Ferdinand empowered his envoys in three missions
to offer an annual pension to Suleiman (a tribute under a
name less offensive to Ferdinand) and at the same time an
annual pension to the grand vizir. When Juritschitz and
Lamberg offered Ibrahim five to six thousand Hungarian
ducats<a name="FNanchor_139_139" id="FNanchor_139_139"></a><a href="#Footnote_139_139" class="fnanchor">139</a> annually for his aid in bringing about peace, he rejected
it so indignantly that they apologized and withdrew
their offer. He said that the previous ambassadors Hobordanacz
and Weixelberger had offered him one hundred
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">86</a></span>thousand florins to buy his protection, but that he said then
and would now repeat that no sort of present could make
him desert the interests of his master, and that he would
prefer to aid in the conquest of the whole world than advise
the Sultan to restore conquered territory.<a name="FNanchor_140_140" id="FNanchor_140_140"></a><a href="#Footnote_140_140" class="fnanchor">140</a></p>

<p>The passage just quoted would seem sufficient to disprove
the assertion made by contemporary European historians
that Ibrahim Pasha had lifted the siege of Vienna
because he had been bought by the gold of the ambassadors.
Suleiman gave him everything that he could have asked and
much more than lay in the power of any European monarch
to bestow. Ibrahim acquired vast wealth, but there is no
evidence that his loyalty to Suleiman could be purchased,
and while the Turkish historians speak often of the avarice
of his successor Rustem Pasha, they never ascribe that
quality to Ibrahim. If he had a price, it was too high for
Ferdinand to pay.</p>

<p>It is apparent from what has been said that Ibrahim’s
diplomatic methods were not subtle; they had no need to
be. As the diplomacy of the Porte was usually either the
introduction to, or the conclusion of a military campaign,
small wonder that it usually attained its object. As the
favor of the Porte was eagerly sought by France, Venice,
Poland, Russia, Hungary and Austria, it required no
finesse of diplomatic handling to deal with their ambassa<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">87</a></span>dors.
Ibrahim, holding all the trumps, needed no great
skill to play his cards well. He might be as rude and boastful
as he would, and still the ambassadors would beg for
his influence in making peace. Both Suleiman and Ibrahim
treated Charles V and Ferdinand with great haughtiness,
nevertheless pursuing an entirely successful policy; France,
on the other hand, playing a subtle game, won considerable
from the Porte. It would seem that the test of Turkish
diplomacy was not its method but its general plan and
large lines. The question then before us is, what were the
objects and accomplishments of Turkish diplomacy between
1525 and 1540.</p>

<p>Suleiman had two objects, first to extend his conquering
power further into Europe, and second to assist Francis I
against the House of Hapsburg. In these two objects he
was successful. His empire was greatly extended during his
reign, both in territory and in influence, while the power of
the rival House of Hapsburg was steadily diminished and
limited. But that which makes of this period an epoch in
European political history is not the territorial aggrandizement
of Turkey, nor the recognition of its power by
Europe, but the first entrance of Turkey into the European
concert, if we may anticipate a later term, and the change
from the consideration of the Turks as merely unbelievers
and foes of Christianity to regarding them as political
allies or foes, and as possible factors in the European question.
At the close of the reign of Selim the Grim, Turkey,
although it was a conquering nation, was still an excrescence
in Europe. But the time had come when it must enter
into the affairs of the Northern nations, and for that time
Suleiman, unusually tolerant towards the West, with a great
idea of the destiny of Turkey, and aided by his Christian
grand vizir, was ready, and by the end of his reign he had
made himself felt in every court on the continent, and had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">88</a></span>
to be reckoned with in every European cabinet. But as a
natural corollary to this fact, Turkey was never, after this
time, wholly free from European influence. The fine wedge
of French intervention was introduced by La Forest in the
treaty of 1535, and conservative Turks of today look on
Suleiman’s “capitulations” as the beginning of endless
troubles for Turkey, while the French still rejoice over the
triumphs of astute and far‐sighted Francis I. “Suleiman en
sortant de son farouche isolement,” says Zeller, “François
I<sup><i>er</i></sup> en bravant les préventions de ses contemporains, accomplirent
une véritable revolution dans la politique de
l’Europe.”<a name="FNanchor_141_141" id="FNanchor_141_141"></a><a href="#Footnote_141_141" class="fnanchor">141</a> For four centuries France remained the most
weighty foreign influence at the Porte. A fuller significance
lay in what Lord Stratford de Redcliffe called the
“extra‐koranic” character of the concessions made in this
reign, the introduction of extra‐koranic legislation in both
foreign and internal affairs, by the side of the maxims and
rules of the Sheri or Holy Law. Turkey began to discover
the inadequacy of Koran legislation for a modern state.<a name="FNanchor_142_142" id="FNanchor_142_142"></a><a href="#Footnote_142_142" class="fnanchor">142</a></p>

<p>How much did Ibrahim Pasha influence Suleiman in this
policy? He undoubtedly had the details in his own hands,
but did he inspire the plan? Probably not. Suleiman knew
pretty clearly what he wanted, and he pursued the same
policy with the same success after the death of Ibrahim.
His contemporaries ascribed to Ibrahim the brain and the
force of Turkish diplomacy, and later historians have given
to him the exclusive credit of this political evolution. But
Zeller’s view<a name="FNanchor_143_143" id="FNanchor_143_143"></a><a href="#Footnote_143_143" class="fnanchor">143</a> that too much importance may be given to
the rôle of Ibrahim Pasha seems better substantiated.
Zeller, nevertheless, in his introduction to <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">La Diplomatie
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">89</a></span>Française</i>, accords to Ibrahim just that credit that peculiarly
belongs to him, if we have rightly understood the work of
the grand vizir, when he says: “Suleiman was not less enlightened
than Francis; he had, as well as the latter, the
knowledge of his own interests, and like him he was partially
enfranchised from the prejudices of his nation....
At the same time we cannot doubt but that the grand vizir,
whose ability and enlightenment are attested by all the
ambassadors, contributed to open the mind of his master
to the ideas outside his realm, to initiate him into a European
Policy, to make him see the menace of the increasing power
of Charles V, and the interest which he had to support
France”. In the unusual liberality of thought and freedom
from prejudice that Suleiman showed in his relation to
Europe, we may see the influence of his intelligent favorite.</p>

<p>Thus the two together, Suleiman and Ibrahim, or Ibrahim
and Suleiman, as Ferdinand often spoke of them, started
the Ottoman Empire from the lonely path of independence
and semibarbarism to the labyrinthine and noisy streets of
European politics.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IV<br /><br />

<small><span class="smcap">Ibrahim the General</span></small></h2>

<p>Suleiman’s reign was one of continuous war, and for
the most part, conquest. His two most redoubtable enemies
were the infidel Hungarians and the heretic Persians.
His first great campaign was directed against Belgrad,
which important city he took in 1521. This conquest he
followed quickly by the victorious siege of Rhodes in 1522.
In these two campaigns, Ibrahim seems to have taken no
part, although he accompanied Suleiman to Rhodes in his
capacity of favorite.<a name="FNanchor_144_144" id="FNanchor_144_144"></a><a href="#Footnote_144_144" class="fnanchor">144</a> But in the first Hungarian campaign
the grand vizir Ibrahim was placed second in command, the
sultan himself leading the expedition.</p>

<p>D’Ohsson gives an account of the ceremonial that used
to precede war in Turkey.<a name="FNanchor_145_145" id="FNanchor_145_145"></a><a href="#Footnote_145_145" class="fnanchor">145</a> He says that the Porte never
failed to legitimize a war by a <em>fetva</em> from the Sheik‐ul‐Islam
given in grand council, after which the sheiks of
the imperial mosques met in the Hall of the Divan and
listened to the intoning of a chapter from the Koran, consecrated
to military expeditions. The first war measure
was the arrest of the ambassador of the country to be attacked,
who was taken to the Seven Towers. The next day
a manifesto was published and sent to each foreign legation;
then followed a <em>Hat‐i‐Shereef</em> conferring command on the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">91</a></span>grand vizir. With the order he received a richly caparisoned
steed and a jeweled sabre, at a most brilliant ceremonial.
Generally war was declared in the autumn, the
winter was occupied in preparation, and the campaign was
undertaken in the spring. At the day and hour appointed
by the court astrologer, the imperial standard was planted
in the court of the grand vizir or the Sultan, while imams<a name="FNanchor_146_146" id="FNanchor_146_146"></a><a href="#Footnote_146_146" class="fnanchor">146</a>
filled the air with blessings and chants. Forty days later
the first encampment was set up with further ceremonies.</p>

<p>The splendor of the Turkish tents, arms and dress were
admired by all observers. A Turkish camp was a lively
place, crowded by priests, dervishes, adventurers and volunteers,
irregular soldiers, servants, tents, and baggage; and,
on the homeward way, laden with slaves and booty.</p>

<p>The Turkish army was at that time the finest in Europe,
both in extent and discipline. The Turks were a fighting
people, whose arms had steadily won them place and power
from the time when their colonel Othman interfered in a
Seljuk quarrel to the time when Suleiman’s armies were the
terror of Europe, and the few hundred tents of Othman
had become the extensive and powerful Ottoman Empire.
The army grew and developed with the demands of the
state, for as we have seen above, the army <em>was</em> the state.
As Mr. Urquhart puts it:<a name="FNanchor_147_147" id="FNanchor_147_147"></a><a href="#Footnote_147_147" class="fnanchor">147</a> “The military branch includes
the whole state. The army was the estates of the
kingdom. The Army had its Courts of Law, and its operations
on the field have never been abandoned to the caprice
of a court or a cabinet.”</p>

<p>Mr. Urquhart classifies the Turkish army under three
main heads:<a name="FNanchor_148_148" id="FNanchor_148_148"></a><a href="#Footnote_148_148" class="fnanchor">148</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">92</a></span></p>

<p>I. Permanent troops: janissaries, hired cavalry and regimental
spahis of the grand artillery, etc.</p>

<p>II. Feudal troops.</p>

<p>III. Provincial troops (<em>Ayalet Askeri</em>).</p>

<p>He reckoned the number of troops at the close of the sixteenth
century as follows:</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Permanent.</span></p>

<table summary="permanent" border="0"><tr>
<td class="tdl padr2">Janissaries</td><td class="tdr">50,000</td></tr><tr>
<td class="tdl padr2">Spahis</td><td class="tdr">250,000</td></tr><tr>
<td class="tdl padr2">Artillery, armourers, etc.</td><td class="tdr">50,000</td></tr>
</table>

<p>Guards besides those drafted from Janissaries and Spahis—war
levies:</p>

<table summary="permanent"><tr>
<td class="tdl padr2">Akinji</td><td class="tdr">40,000</td></tr><tr>
<td class="tdl padr2">Ayab</td><td class="tdr">100,000</td></tr><tr>
<td class="tdl padr2">Ayalet Askeri (cavalry)</td><td class="tdr">40,000</td></tr><tr>
<td class="tdl padr2">Miri Askeri (infantry)</td><td class="tdr">100,000</td></tr>
</table>

<p>Some explanation of these names will be desirable. The
feudal and provincial troops were those whose military service
was demanded by the feudal tenure of the <em>timars</em> or
fiefs. Of the permanent troops, the celebrated body of the
Spahis was recruited from the fiefs, sons of the Spahis being
preferred, and were required to follow the banner of the
Sultan himself. The Akinji were the light horse, the
terror of the Germans and the Hungarians. The Ayab
were infantry, a sort of Cossack on foot, as the Akinjis
were Cossacks on horseback—without either the pay of the
janissaries or the fiefs of the spahis. The famous corps of
the janissaries was the heart of the army,—the most privileged,
the most terrible, the most efficient of the soldiery.
They were recruited from the children, taken in tribute
from the conquered Christian states, a thousand a year,
and generally became Moslems. The janissaries, the artillery
and the guards were the only soldiery paid from
the treasury. The Turkish conquerors made war pay for
itself, living on the conquered country and carrying home<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">93</a></span>
immense loot. At the close of his careful pamphlet, Mr.
Urquhart makes an interesting distinction between Janissary
and Turkish principles. He claims that the former
are “violence, corruption, and prostration of military
strength, exhaustion of the treasury, resistance to all, and
therefore to beneficial, change.” The Turkish principles, he
claims, are altogether different and finer.<a name="FNanchor_149_149" id="FNanchor_149_149"></a><a href="#Footnote_149_149" class="fnanchor">149</a></p>

<p>The Turkish artillery was very formidable. It was by
means of this and the setting of mines that Belgrad and
Rhodes had been taken. There was no navy. There were
a number of pirates, freebooters who put themselves at the
service of the Sultan and won some considerable naval
victories, but they were not a part of the regular Turkish
force.</p>

<p>One constant order of battle was observed. The provincial
troops of Asia formed the right wing, and those of
Europe the left, the center being composed of regular
bodies of cavalry and infantry, the janissaries forming the
front line. In Europe the home contingents occupied the
right wing. Thus were combined permanent and disciplined
infantry and cavalry with irregular foot and horse; a feudal
establishment with provincial armaments, and forces raised
by conscription, by enlistment, and by tribute. By this arrangement
the sultan could bring three enormous armies
into the field simultaneously in the heart of Europe and
Asia.<a name="FNanchor_150_150" id="FNanchor_150_150"></a><a href="#Footnote_150_150" class="fnanchor">150</a></p>

<p>A quaint description of the discipline of the Turkish army
in 1585 was given by one William Watreman in his book
entitled “The Fardle of Facions”, who thought that the
speed, the courage and the obedience of the Turkish soldiers
accounted easily for their great success in war for
two hundred years,<a name="FNanchor_151_151" id="FNanchor_151_151"></a><a href="#Footnote_151_151" class="fnanchor">151</a> and said that they were little given to
mutinies and “stirs”.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">94</a></span></p>

<p>Watreman was evidently not speaking of the privileged
janissaries here, for they were greatly given to mutinies and
“stirs.” They realized the immense power that the army
possessed, and how definitely the sultan was in their hands.
That part of the army stationed at Constantinople as guard
to His Imperial Majesty had it in their power to demand
the degradation and the head of any hated official, and usually
these demands were granted. Authorized by the laws
of their predecessors and their own as well, they might
furthermore imprison the sultan himself, put him to death,
and place on the throne one of his relatives as his successor.
When all the corps of this militia of Constantinople
unite under the orders of the Ulema, who give the
weight of law to the undertaking, the despotic sultan passes
from the throne to a prison cell, where a mysterious and
illegal death soon removes him.<a name="FNanchor_152_152" id="FNanchor_152_152"></a><a href="#Footnote_152_152" class="fnanchor">152</a> The long list of deposed
sultans witnesses to this power. Little wonder then that
Suleiman, after punishing the rebellious janissaries in 1525,
planned to employ them immediately in a campaign.</p>

<p>On Monday, April 23rd, Suleiman left Constantinople
with 100,000 men and 300 cannon.<a name="FNanchor_153_153" id="FNanchor_153_153"></a><a href="#Footnote_153_153" class="fnanchor">153</a> His grand vizir had
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">95</a></span>started a week in advance, commanding the vanguard of
the army, largely cavalry. At Sophia both armies encamped,
and the grand vizir is said to have “dressed his
tent like a tulip in purple veilings.”<a name="FNanchor_154_154" id="FNanchor_154_154"></a><a href="#Footnote_154_154" class="fnanchor">154</a> From this point the
two armies separated. Ibrahim Pasha threw a bridge
across the Save, and advanced to Peterwardein, a natural
fort on the foot‐hills of the Fruska‐Gora mountains, which
was manned by a thousand poorly equipped soldiers. Suleiman
ordered Ibrahim Pasha to take Peterwardein, assuring
him it would be but a bite to last him till breakfast in
Vienna.<a name="FNanchor_155_155" id="FNanchor_155_155"></a><a href="#Footnote_155_155" class="fnanchor">155</a> The sultan then proceeded to Belgrad. The
grand vizir began preparations for the siege, storming ladders
were laid, and on July 15th the first attack was made
and repulsed with loss. The next night Ibrahim sent a
division of the army to the other side of the Danube, and
the fight continued all the following day until late evening,
both by river and land, a flotilla of small boats being on the
Danube. In a second assault the Turks pressed into the
lower city, but they were again repulsed. Ibrahim, convinced
that storming was less easy then he had thought, now prepared
for a regular siege. After several day’s fighting a
great building in the fort fell, and the walls were broached
in several places. Nevertheless the besieged withstood two
more assaults, and made a sally by which the Turks sustained
great loss. At length Ibrahim laid mines under the
walls of the fort, and on the 23rd day of July, twelve days
from the first attack, an explosion, followed by a great assault
and hard fighting, resulted in the taking of the place.
Only ninety men were left to lay down their arms. The
Turkish loss also had been heavy.<a name="FNanchor_156_156" id="FNanchor_156_156"></a><a href="#Footnote_156_156" class="fnanchor">156</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">96</a></span></p>

<p>The successful siege, and doubtless also the rich reward
of his padisha, decided Ibrahim Pasha to besiege Illok on
the Danube, which he took in seven days. The sultan now
announced that the objective point of the expedition was
Buda. The Turkish army advanced along the Danube,
devastating as it went, to the marshy plain of Mohacz.
Here there was a battle of the first importance in its political
results, as we have seen above, for it routed the
Hungarian army, killed King Lewis, and gave Hungary
into Suleiman’s hands. It was a brief and bloody battle,
lasting but two hours. Petchevi gives picturesque scenes
before the battle, and tells of the vast enthusiasm that seized
“the holy army”, while Kemalpashazadeh gloats particularly
on “the bloody festival.” The plan of the battle was
made by the sultan in conjunction with his grand vizir, who
visited the former several times during the evening preceding
the battle. At dawn on August 29th, 1526, the Turkish
army emerged from a wood and appeared before
the Hungarians. First came the army of Roumelie, a
part of the janissaries, and the artillery under Ibrahim
Pasha. Then came 10,000 janissaries and the artillery of
Anatolia under Behram Pasha; behind him was the Sultan
and his body guards, janissaries and cavalry.</p>

<p>Towards noon the Sultan occupied the height commanding
the town and saw his enemies ranged before him. The
first attack was made by the Hungarians and was successful
in producing confusion in the Turkish ranks. But the
Turks rallied, and the Akinjis drew off the attack. Ibrahim
was always in the forefront, animating his men and “fighting
like a lion.” “By acts of intrepidity he snatched from
the hearts of his heroes the arrow of the fear of death.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">97</a></span>He restored their failing spirits. Before the most fearful
weapons he never moved an eyelash.”<a name="FNanchor_157_157" id="FNanchor_157_157"></a><a href="#Footnote_157_157" class="fnanchor">157</a> King Lewis, with
thirty brave followers, pushed towards the Sultan in a desperate
attempt to take his life, but it was the young king
himself who fell instead in the terrible fight. The artillery,
discharging its first volley, caused frightful confusion especially
in the left wing. The Hungarian right wing, surrounded
on all sides, broke and fled, being cut down by the
Turks, or drowned in the marsh. The slaughter was fearful,
as no prisoners were taken.<a name="FNanchor_158_158" id="FNanchor_158_158"></a><a href="#Footnote_158_158" class="fnanchor">158</a> The battle was so tragic
to the Hungarians that to this day, when disaster overtakes
one of them, the proverb is quoted: “No matter, more was
lost on Mohacz field.”<a name="FNanchor_159_159" id="FNanchor_159_159"></a><a href="#Footnote_159_159" class="fnanchor">159</a></p>

<p>The artillery of the grand vizir seems to have turned
the day and rendered the victory decisive for the Turks.
The following day Suleiman, seated under a scarlet pavillion,
on a golden throne brought from Constantinople,
received the congratulations of his vizirs and beylerbeys
and with his own hand placed an aigrette of diamonds
on the head of his grand vizir. In gruesome contrast
to this splendor was a pyramid of one thousand heads
of noble Hungarians piled before the imperial tent.
Mohacz was burned, and the Akinjis harried the country
in horrid fashion,<a name="FNanchor_160_160" id="FNanchor_160_160"></a><a href="#Footnote_160_160" class="fnanchor">160</a> while the main army marched on to
Buda. Here the keys of the city were offered to Suleiman,
and the campaign was ended, except for the march back to
Constantinople, with its details of massacre and spoliation.<a name="FNanchor_161_161" id="FNanchor_161_161"></a><a href="#Footnote_161_161" class="fnanchor">161</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">98</a></span></p>

<p>The credit for this successful Hungarian campaign is ascribed
to the grand vizir by three very good authorities.
Ibrahim himself, in a speech to the ambassador von Zara,
claims to have conquered Hungary:<a name="FNanchor_162_162" id="FNanchor_162_162"></a><a href="#Footnote_162_162" class="fnanchor">162</a> the sultan, in a letter
of victory to his provinces, gives honor to Ibrahim; and
the sheik‐ul‐Islam Kemalpashazadeh, in his epic history of
the battle of Mohacz, lavishes praise on the grand vizir as
commander of the armies on that field. “Heaven has
never seen,” he rhapsodizes, “and never will see a combat
equal to that by the prince of the champions of the faith, of
this Asaf of Wisdom, this experienced general, this lion‐hearted
Ardeshir, I mean Ibrahim Pasha.<a name="FNanchor_163_163" id="FNanchor_163_163"></a><a href="#Footnote_163_163" class="fnanchor">163</a> The enemy of
the enemies of the Holy War, in an instant he repulsed the
shock of the enemies of the faith.”<a name="FNanchor_164_164" id="FNanchor_164_164"></a><a href="#Footnote_164_164" class="fnanchor">164</a></p>

<p>Suleiman in his letter gives Ibrahim credit for the taking
of Peterwardein and Illok. As to Mohacz he says:<a name="FNanchor_165_165" id="FNanchor_165_165"></a><a href="#Footnote_165_165" class="fnanchor">165</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p class="tb">“The accursed king (Lewis) accompanied by the soldiers of
perdition fell before the army of Roumelie, which was commanded
by the Beylerbey of Roumelie, my grand vizir, Ibrahim
Pasha (May Allah glorify him eternally!). It was then
that the hero displayed all his innate valor.”</p></blockquote>

<p class="tb">The first mention of Ibrahim in this letter is in the following
terms:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="tb">“The leopard of strength and valor, the tiger of the forest
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">99</a></span>
of courage, the hero filled with a holy zeal, the Rustem of
the arena of victory, the lion of the restoration of dominion,
the precious pearl of the ocean of all power, the champion of
the faith, the Grand Vizir, Beylerbey of Roumelie, Ibrahim
Pasha.”<a name="FNanchor_166_166" id="FNanchor_166_166"></a><a href="#Footnote_166_166" class="fnanchor">166</a></p></blockquote>

<p class="tb">The flowers of the Sultan’s rhetoric may be accepted as
a matter of course, but the fact that he mentions Ibrahim
as deserving of any share in the glory of the imperial conquests
is noteworthy, as in his letters of victory he usually
reserves all the honor for Allah and himself.<a name="FNanchor_167_167" id="FNanchor_167_167"></a><a href="#Footnote_167_167" class="fnanchor">167</a></p>

<p>The campaign of Vienna was the next military event for
Ibrahim. It was on the eve of this expedition that Suleiman
invested the grand vizir with the office of Serasker.<a name="FNanchor_168_168" id="FNanchor_168_168"></a><a href="#Footnote_168_168" class="fnanchor">168</a></p>

<p>Says Petchevi:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="tb">One day, going from the Divan to the Vizir Khaneh, the great
Lord and Conqueror calling the slaves before his presence addressed
them with eloquent and pearl‐scattering words and
with divine proceedings, saying: “Nothing prevents our extending
our arms at once to all parts of our land, but in every
case we cannot personally conduct affairs. Therefore we formulate
a <em>berat‐i‐shereef</em> that Ibrahim Pasha, in the name of
Serasker may receive obedience and respect.”</p></blockquote>

<p class="tb">Here Petchevi quotes the berat that was given in Chapter
III, and then continues with an account of the splendid
presents sent to Ibrahim with the berat, and the congratulations
of all the ulema and vizirs.<a name="FNanchor_169_169" id="FNanchor_169_169"></a><a href="#Footnote_169_169" class="fnanchor">169</a> According to D’Ohsson,
the investiture of Ibrahim was unusually splendid and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">100</a></span>solemn. He tells of processions in the streets and visits
to the palace and continued cermonial after the army had
started. When the ambassadors had visited him with congratulations
and hopes of his success, he always replied:</p>

<p>“Marching under the divine protection, under influence
of the sacred banner, under the auspices of the grandest,
most powerful of monarchs, I hope to gain brilliant victories
over the enemies of the empire, and soon return
triumphant.”<a name="FNanchor_170_170" id="FNanchor_170_170"></a><a href="#Footnote_170_170" class="fnanchor">170</a></p>

<p>It is not possible to go into all the details of the famous
first siege of Vienna, to which entire books have been devoted.<a name="FNanchor_171_171" id="FNanchor_171_171"></a><a href="#Footnote_171_171" class="fnanchor">171</a>
Our account of it must be brief. On September
28th, 1529, Ibrahim Pasha stood before Vienna with
the Roumelian troops, and by the 28th the main body
of the army headed by the sultan was encamped before
the city. The defenses of Vienna were in bad repair,
with only 16,000 men and 72 guns, against a Turkish
army of 300,000. The garrison was commanded by Philip
of Bavaria, Ferdinand remaining in Linz, in hopes of aid
from the German princes. The defenders of the city made
desperate efforts to strengthen it, tearing down houses that
stood too close to the walls, leveling suburbs that might protect
the enemy, and erecting earthen defences and new
walls where necessary. To save some of the horrors of the
siege, the old men, the women and children, and the priests
were forced to leave the city.<a name="FNanchor_172_172" id="FNanchor_172_172"></a><a href="#Footnote_172_172" class="fnanchor">172</a> Suleiman thought the taking
of this stronghold would be easy, and summoned the
garrison to surrender, saying that if they refused he would
breakfast in Vienna on the third day, and would spare no
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">101</a></span>one. But the third day passed and many others and the
Turks were still digging under the towers and walls and
laying mines. They had been compelled by heavy rains to
leave their siege guns behind them, and had only field pieces
and musketry. The besieged replied to mine by countermine
and effectually circumvented the Turkish plans.
Storming parties of the Turks were met by sallies from the
beleaguered, and Suleiman’s breakfast, as the Viennese
scornfully told him, was getting cold. Breaches made in
the walls on October 9th and 11th were repaired and defended
by the undaunted Austrians, and after a splendid
effort made on October 14th to storm the city, and an
equally splendid and more successful resistance, the sultan
was obliged to give up the siege. It was Suleiman’s first
defeat, and he found it hard to accept it, but winter was
coming on, provisions were inadequate for so long a campaign,
the army was discouraged, and furthermore, outside
help was known to be on the way to the beleaguered city
from all quarters. On October 14th the signal for retreat
was given. The loss to the Turkish army was great, and
that of the Viennese slight.<a name="FNanchor_173_173" id="FNanchor_173_173"></a><a href="#Footnote_173_173" class="fnanchor">173</a></p>

<p>Ibrahim Pasha had charge of the operations during the
siege, and went often to reconnoiter the fortifications, disguised
in a colored turban instead of the usual one of
white and gold.<a name="FNanchor_174_174" id="FNanchor_174_174"></a><a href="#Footnote_174_174" class="fnanchor">174</a> Count Christopher von Zedlitz, a prisoner
in the Turkish camp, said: “In this expedition there
was Ibrahim Pasha, who in this war counselled and directed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">102</a></span>everything.”<a name="FNanchor_175_175" id="FNanchor_175_175"></a><a href="#Footnote_175_175" class="fnanchor">175</a> There were at this siege, as in all campaigns,
frequent largesses to keep up the courage of the soldiers.
The grand vizir was surrounded by sacks of gold, of which
he gave by the handful when an enemy’s head was brought
in, or an important capture made. When the lure of gold
was insufficient to arouse the ebbing courage of the soldiers
in the prolonged siege, the officers with the grand vizir at
their head urged them forward with blows of sticks and
whips and sabres. On October 12th Ibrahim assembled the
beys of Roumelie, spoke frankly of the discontent and hunger
of the army, and urged one more assault, promising
whether it were successful or not, to sound the retreat
thereafter.<a name="FNanchor_176_176" id="FNanchor_176_176"></a><a href="#Footnote_176_176" class="fnanchor">176</a> As we have seen, the assault was made and
failed, and the siege was raised and the retreat commenced.
When Suleiman left Vienna the grand vizir remained for
some time with cavalry in the neighborhood of the city,
partly to cover the retreat, and partly to rally the akinji
scattered on plundering expeditions. He also received proposals
for an exchange of prisoners, to which he replied
as follows:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Ibrahim Pasha, by the grace of God First Vizir, Secretary
and Chief Councillor of the glorious, great and invincible Emperor,
Sultan Suleiman, head and minister of his whole
dominion, of his slaves and sandjaks, Generalissimo of his
armies:</p>

<p>High‐born, magnanimous officers and commanders; having
received your writing sent by your messenger, we have digested
its contents. Know that we are not come to take your
city into our possession, but only to seek out your Archduke
Ferdinand, whom however we have not found, and hence have
waited here so many days, without his appearing. Yesterday
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">103</a></span>moreover we set free three of your prisoners, for which measure
you should fain to do likewise of those in your possession,
as we have desired your messenger to explain to you by word
of mouth. You may therefore send hither one of your own
people to seek out your countrymen, and without anxiety for
our good faith, for what happened to those of Pesth was not
our fault but their own.</p></blockquote>

<p>In this letter Ibrahim makes the statement which Suleiman
sent forth officially, namely,—that the Turks did not
wish to take Vienna, but only to meet Ferdinand. A mile
away from the camp the sultan halted and received congratulations
as for a victory, and dispensed rewards, the
grand vizir receiving four costly pellisses and five purses.<a name="FNanchor_177_177" id="FNanchor_177_177"></a><a href="#Footnote_177_177" class="fnanchor">177</a></p>

<p>The next fortress to be besieged by Ibrahim Pasha was
Güns, in 1532. This was the critical point of Suleiman’s
fifth Hungarian campaign. After the sultan alone had reduced
some thirteen minor forts, he associated the grand
vizir with him in this great siege. The little fortress of
Güns was brilliantly defended by Nicholas Juritschitz, who
had met Ibrahim in former days when ambassador at the
Porte.</p>

<p>On August 9th the grand vizir encamped before Güns,
and three days later Suleiman arrived. Many small
cannon were used in this siege, the largest sending a ball the
size of a goose egg, which was, nevertheless, very effective
in destroying the battlements. Besides continual assaults,
mines were laid, but it was twelve days before Ibrahim summoned
the sturdy Juritschitz to surrender. Even then another
assault was necessary, which was at first unsuccessful
owing to a very curious event. The old men, women and
children within the city, seeing the banners of the janissaries
planted on the walls, uttered such piercing cries of fear and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">104</a></span>horror that the assailants were seized with a panic as at
something supernatural, and fled from the spot. But their
return was so fierce that a breach was made, and the brave
Juritschitz, wounded and helpless, was obliged to accept Ibrahim‘s
terms.<a name="FNanchor_178_178" id="FNanchor_178_178"></a><a href="#Footnote_178_178" class="fnanchor">178</a> Using his knowledge of the grand vizir’s nature
obtained during his embassy to the Porte, he played
on his vanity and obtained very good conditions.<a name="FNanchor_179_179" id="FNanchor_179_179"></a><a href="#Footnote_179_179" class="fnanchor">179</a>] Güns
was not pillaged, and only formally capitulated, ten janissaries
being allowed to remain an hour in the place in order
to erect a Turkish standard. So Juritschitz, writing to Ferdinand
exclaims: “God Almighty delivered me and this
people from the hand of tyranny, which honor all my life
has not deserved.”</p>

<p>The delay and practical defeat sustained at Güns, together
with the defeat of another Turkish army which was
to enter Austria by the Semmering Pass proved the saving
of Vienna. Suleiman had announced that he did not intend
to attack Vienna on this campaign; nevertheless his
vast preparation and the counter‐preparations of Charles V
and of Germany suggested a more ambitious campaign than
that which he carried out. In any case Suleiman decided to
withdraw, and immediately after investing Gratz, which
was well defended, he abandoned the enterprise and returned
to the Porte.</p>

<p>When the Sultan made peace with Ferdinand in 1533, and
temporarily ceased operations on his northern frontier, he
turned his attention to conquests in two other directions,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">105</a></span>namely to the extension of his sea power, and to the reduction
of Persia. The romantic story of the exploits of
his great admiral Khaireddin Barbarosa does not come
into our field, but the Persian campaign is the next object
of our attention.</p>

<p>Ever since Suleiman’s accession to the throne the relations
of the Porte with the Shah of Persia had been strained.
The only reason that this had not resulted in open war
was because Suleiman was more deeply concerned in Hungarian
affairs. There was continual fighting on the frontier.
When Shah Tahmasp succeeded his father Ismail, he
was little inclined to humble himself before the Turkish
monarch, so he resented an overbearing and threatening letter
from Suleiman. Now seemed a favorable moment to
execute the threat of war. The excuse was the betrayal of
the Ottomans by the khan of Bitlis, who had gone over to
the shah of Persia, while the Persians were irate because the
Persian governor of Aserbaijan and Baghdad had joined
the Turks and had taken with him the keys of Baghdad.
The governor having been assassinated and Baghdad retaken
by the Persians, Suleiman determined on immediate
war.</p>

<p>Ibrahim, again invested with the office of serasker, was
sent to Persia to retake Bitlis and Baghdad. He and
his army marched as far as Konia, where he received
the head of Sherefbey, after which he advanced to
Aleppo to take up his winter quarters.<a name="FNanchor_180_180" id="FNanchor_180_180"></a><a href="#Footnote_180_180" class="fnanchor">180</a> He occupied his
leisure during the winter by taking several neighboring
fortresses. His next plan was to move on Baghdad, but
the defterdar Iskender Chelebi who accompanied the expedition
urged an immediate advance to Tebriz, recently
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">106</a></span>abandoned by the shah, arguing that the fall of Tebriz
would mean the taking of Baghdad. Ibrahim followed
Iskender’s suggestion, and arrived before Tebriz the 13th of
July, 1534. Receiving the submission of many fortresses
en route, he triumphantly entered the Persian capital. To
avert the evils generally incident to a Turkish occupation, he
set up a judge at Tebriz, and a strong guard. This was
unusual self‐restraint in a Turkish conqueror. At this time
he suffered the loss of one of his armies in the defile of Kiseljedagh,
but otherwise he met only with victory and submission.</p>

<p>On the 27th of September Suleiman joined the grand
vizir at Aoudjan and immediately rewarded him and the
other beylerbeys for their successes. The united armies
continued their march towards Hamadan. The lateness of
the season made the crossing of the mountains very difficult.
Many pack animals died and the artillery was mired in the
bad roads. In that perilous situation the army was attacked
by the enemy and suffered considerable loss in men
and supplies.</p>

<p>At last the army reached Baghdad. The governor sent
a letter of submission, and then to secure his own safety,
fled. The grand vizir immediately took possession of the
city, shut the gates to prevent pillage, and sent the keys
of the city to Suleiman who had not yet come up. Baghdad
was the bulwark of the Persian empire and of great
military importance. The army remained there four
months while the sultan organized his new conquests.
April 2nd, 1535, the Turkish army commenced its return
to its capital, making a march of three months to
Tebriz and thence of six months to Stambul.</p>

<p>In this campaign Ibrahim had little actual fighting, and
slight use for the artillery and mines in which he was so
well versed. The success of the campaign was due to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">107</a></span>
terror excited by the reputation of the Turkish army, and the
endurance with which it made terrible marches, equalling
the celebrated marches of the generals of antiquity.<a name="FNanchor_181_181" id="FNanchor_181_181"></a><a href="#Footnote_181_181" class="fnanchor">181</a> Ferdinand
of Hungary wrote Ibrahim congratulating him on
this successful campaign.</p>

<p>This was Ibrahim’s last campaign. His career was cut
short at this point. In this Persian expedition the grand
vizir had some personal experiences which do not properly
belong to an account of his generalship, but rather to the
next chapter dealing with his fall.</p>

<p>In these varied campaigns Ibrahim Pasha showed himself
an able and generally successful general. In all of his
battles and sieges he was defeated only at Vienna, and
practically, although not nominally, at Güns. He was brilliant
in his attacks, especially with artillery, the battle of
Mohacz being the best illustration of this. He was excellent
in mines and sieges, regardless of the fact that he
did not succeed in reducing Vienna. He was strong in
marching, as the great march across Persia witnesses. He
generally had good control over his men, although at Vienna
he failed to incite them to greater efforts. He was personally
brave and fearless, leading his troops and betaking
himself to the point of greatest danger. He seems to have
been less cruel than was usual among Turkish conquerors,
although his army committed some horrid atrocities. He
followed the usual custom of looting, which made war so
attractive to the Turkish soldier.<a name="FNanchor_182_182" id="FNanchor_182_182"></a><a href="#Footnote_182_182" class="fnanchor">182</a> He appreciated valor
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">108</a></span>even in his enemies, as the story of his treatment of the
prisoner Zedlitz and his freeing of him illustrates.<a name="FNanchor_183_183" id="FNanchor_183_183"></a><a href="#Footnote_183_183" class="fnanchor">183</a> The
credit for the conquests of this period must be divided between
Sultan Suleiman and his grand vizir, who was able to
push all plans of Suleiman, whether military or diplomatic,
to a fortunate conclusion.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER V<br /><br />

<small><span class="smcap">Ibrahim’s Fall</span></small></h2>

<p><span class="smcap">On</span> March 5th, 1536<a name="FNanchor_184_184" id="FNanchor_184_184"></a><a href="#Footnote_184_184" class="fnanchor">184</a> Ibrahim Pasha betook himself to
the imperial palace in Stamboul to dine with the sultan and
spend the night with his Majesty, according to a long established
custom. In the morning his body was found with
marks on it, showing that he had been strangled after a
fierce struggle.<a name="FNanchor_185_185" id="FNanchor_185_185"></a><a href="#Footnote_185_185" class="fnanchor">185</a> A horse with black trappings carried the
dishonored body home,<a name="FNanchor_186_186" id="FNanchor_186_186"></a><a href="#Footnote_186_186" class="fnanchor">186</a> and it was immediately buried in a
dervish monastery in Galata, with no monument to mark its
resting place.<a name="FNanchor_187_187" id="FNanchor_187_187"></a><a href="#Footnote_187_187" class="fnanchor">187</a> His immense property fell to the crown,<a name="FNanchor_188_188" id="FNanchor_188_188"></a><a href="#Footnote_188_188" class="fnanchor">188</a>
and Ibrahim Pasha, the mighty grand vizir, was dropped
out of mind and conversation as though he had not practically
ruled the empire for thirteen years.</p>

<p>What caused this abrupt extinction of Suleiman’s love for
his former favorite? Ibrahim naturally had many enemies,
among them the most influential ones being the defterdar
Iskender Chelebi, and Roxelana, the favorite wife of Suleiman.
These appear to have worked for years to poison
Suleiman’s mind against the grand vizir, but for a long
time without success.<a name="FNanchor_189_189" id="FNanchor_189_189"></a><a href="#Footnote_189_189" class="fnanchor">189</a> What charges could they bring
against him?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">110</a></span></p>

<p>Ibrahim, we recall, was born a Christian, and probably
accepted Islam only formally and not from conviction.
Now and then in his career his Christian predilections appear
and always injure his reputation. One instance of
this was the case of the infidel Cabyz, towards whom Ibrahim
was accused of being overlenient. Another illustration
of lack of consideration for Moslem prejudices was
when he brought home from Buda three statues taken from
the royal palace and set them up in the Hippodrome. This
was in defiance of the Moslem rule, observed literally, to
permit the display of “no images of anything in the
heaven above, the earth beneath, or the water under the
earth.” Although Ibrahim was supported in this act by
the tolerant sultan, it brought down on his head a clamor
of horror. He was spoken of as an idolator, and the poet
Fighani Chelebi composed a satire against him which was
never forgotten. It ran:</p>

<div class="poetry‐container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line i05">“Two Abrahams came into the world;</div>
<div class="line">The one destroyed idols, the other set them up.”</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>The audacious poet paid for his wit with his life, but the
satire remained popular. Ibrahim became less and less
careful in religious matters as his power became more assured.
A contemporary wrote:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>The opinionated pasha at the beginning of his power was
very docile in every respect to the Holy Law, besides which
it was his custom to consult wise men in every affair of his
desire; and his faith in Islam was so strong that if some one
brought a Koran to him, he would gracefully rise to his feet
and kiss it and lay it on his forehead and hold it level with
his breast, not one inch below. But later when he went to
Baghdad as serasker and mixed with infamous or foolish people,
his character changed to such a degree that he did not
regard the lives of innocent men more highly than fine dust,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">111</a></span>and if some one brought him as a gift a Koran or a beautifully‐written
manuscript, as he saw him approaching he
would become angry and refuse it, saying, “Why do you
bring them to me? There is no end to the good books that I
possess,” and sometimes he would revile the men.<a name="FNanchor_190_190" id="FNanchor_190_190"></a><a href="#Footnote_190_190" class="fnanchor">190</a></p></blockquote>

<p>The Venetians seem to have regarded Ibrahim as favorable
to them, and needy Christians in the empire turned to
him for help and sometimes were freed by him from captivity
and death.<a name="FNanchor_191_191" id="FNanchor_191_191"></a><a href="#Footnote_191_191" class="fnanchor">191</a> His parents remained Christians. It is
doubtful whether these last facts would arouse any feeling
against the grand vizir; but the disregard of Moslem sensibilities
noted above was very unwise and would give his
enemies a point of attack although it was rather unlikely
by itself to influence greatly the confidence of the sultan,
a monarch noted for his unusual tolerance towards beliefs
outside of Islam. But Ibrahim permitted himself another
imprudence that was far more dangerous.</p>

<p>As we have studied Ibrahim’s career, we have seen the
vast power that he gradually gathered into his hands, and
we have noted the amazement with which European legates
listened to his own accounts of his standing in the state.
He was practically the ruler of the Ottoman empire, but
there was one fact that he forgot; he was absolutely at
the disposal of the sultan and could be disgraced or executed
at the latter’s caprice—he was but the shadow of the
“Shadow of God” on earth.<a name="FNanchor_192_192" id="FNanchor_192_192"></a><a href="#Footnote_192_192" class="fnanchor">192</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">112</a></span></p>

<p>On the Persian expedition he made the grave mistake of
assuming the title of <em>Serasker‐Sultan</em>. Although as von
Hammer points out<a name="FNanchor_193_193" id="FNanchor_193_193"></a><a href="#Footnote_193_193" class="fnanchor">193</a> the title of <em>sultan</em> was commonly borne
by small Kurdish rulers in the country in which Ibrahim
then was, yet at Constantinople there was but <em>one</em> sultan,
and to usurp his title was to lay one’s self open to the charge
of unlawful ambition.<a name="FNanchor_194_194" id="FNanchor_194_194"></a><a href="#Footnote_194_194" class="fnanchor">194</a> Moreover as Ahmed Pasha had
assumed the title upon his revolt in Egypt, the association
with disloyalty must have been very strong to Suleiman.
There were plenty of courtiers ready to interpret his action
thus in reporting to the sultan. Here was a charge that
Suleiman could hardly ignore even though he might disbelieve
it for a while.</p>

<p>The immediate cause of Ibrahim’s fall was his quarrel
with Iskender Chelebi.<a name="FNanchor_195_195" id="FNanchor_195_195"></a><a href="#Footnote_195_195" class="fnanchor">195</a> A relationship between the two
men had long existed and for years had been unfriendly.
When Ibrahim was sent to Egypt Iskender was in his train.
Ibrahim’s wealth and power were a source of envy to the
defterdar, while the latter’s personality seems to have become
disagreeable to the grand vizir. On the expedition
to Persia the smouldering hatred between the two men
broke into flame. When Ibrahim proposed to take the title
of Serasker‐Sultan, the defterdar attempted to dissuade him
and thus aroused Ibrahim’s resentment. There was also
an ostentatious display of wealth, the defterdar and the
grand vizir each attempting to send to the army a larger
number of more richly equipped soldiers, and each considering
the other’s contribution mean. Insults were exchanged.
At length Ibrahim accused the defterdar of taking money
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">113</a></span>from the royal treasury, and brought witnesses against him
who were probably in Ibrahim’s pay. It became a war to the
death between the two enemies. Ibrahim doubtless knew that
if Iskender lived he himself would be sacrificed. So he accomplished
the disgrace and execution of the treasurer but
he did not thereby secure his own safety. Iskender
Chelebi, accused of intrigues against his master, as well as
mismanagement of the public funds, was hanged at Baghdad.
As he went to the gallows he sent a Parthian shot at
his murderer. Calling for pen and paper, he made a written
statement that not only was he guilty of conspiring with
the Persians but that Ibrahim was equally guilty, and that
the latter had plotted to attempt Suleiman’s life, lured by
Persian gold.<a name="FNanchor_196_196" id="FNanchor_196_196"></a><a href="#Footnote_196_196" class="fnanchor">196</a> However we may doubt Iskender’s honesty
in making a statement that would draw down on his enemy
his own fate, the Turkish sultan would be unlikely to question
it, for among the Turks the testimony of a dying man
or one led to execution is of very great weight. In law it
outweighs that of forty ordinary witnesses.<a name="FNanchor_197_197" id="FNanchor_197_197"></a><a href="#Footnote_197_197" class="fnanchor">197</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">114</a></span></p>

<p>Suleiman’s conviction of his vizir’s guilt was further
strengthened, as the Turkish chronicles relate, by a vision in
which the murdered defterdar appeared surrounded by a
celestial halo. He reproached Suleiman for submitting to
the usurpation of his grand vizir, and finally threw himself
on the sultan as though to strangle him.<a name="FNanchor_198_198" id="FNanchor_198_198"></a><a href="#Footnote_198_198" class="fnanchor">198</a> Suleiman, once
convinced of Ibrahim’s guilt or of the menace he was to his
power, acted secretly and silently. He did not confront his
favorite with accusations nor give him a chance to exculpate
himself,<a name="FNanchor_199_199" id="FNanchor_199_199"></a><a href="#Footnote_199_199" class="fnanchor">199</a> but disposed of him swiftly. As Lamartine
says,<a name="FNanchor_200_200" id="FNanchor_200_200"></a><a href="#Footnote_200_200" class="fnanchor">200</a> “Ibrahim’s life ended without reverses and perhaps
without other crimes than greatness.” A brilliant career
for thirteen years, even though followed by sudden disgrace
and death, is a fate that might be envied by many. The
abruptness of Ibrahim’s fall is paralleled many times in
Turkish history, which is full of sensational rises and falls.
In the history of his life alone, we have seen Ahmed Pasha
of Egypt and Iskender Chelebi rise to great heights and
quickly descend to disgrace and death. It was the almost
limitless possibility of rising, and the ever present danger
of falling that constituted the fascination of Turkish public
life. One could hardly start with a handicap too severe
to prevent him from attaining greatness. On the other
hand one was never sure of retaining for twenty‐four hours
the power, wealth and rank that he had attained, for a mo<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">115</a></span>mentary
caprice of the monarch might end it abruptly.
Even the sultan himself might suddenly be overthrown and
fill a dungeon cell or a grave, while his successor taken
from a harem or a prison ascended the mighty throne. Nowhere
have life and its possibilities been more uncertain
than on or near the Ottoman throne.</p>

<p>Let us consider in conclusion the question of Ibrahim’s relations
to Suleiman. Was he a traitor or not? Baudier says
that Suleiman confronted Ibrahim with his own letters to
Charles V and Ferdinand and that he had secret intelligence
with the Austrians. In the papers collected by Gévay which
seem complete as to the correspondence between Ibrahim
and the Austrian ruler, there are no such letters, nor are
they found in any other collection nor mentioned by the
Austrians themselves. On the contrary, we have despatches
from Ferdinand to Ibrahim written July 5th, 1535, March
23, 1535, and March 14, 1536, after his death, urging Ibrahim’s
continued offices and expressing gratitude for his efforts
to keep peace between the two countries.<a name="FNanchor_201_201" id="FNanchor_201_201"></a><a href="#Footnote_201_201" class="fnanchor">201</a></p>

<p>The charge of collusion with the Austrians which we
have examined and discussed in connection with the siege
of Vienna we here dismiss as being supported by very insufficient
data. What had Ibrahim to gain by accepting
money or position from Charles? Could the latter give
him the half of what Suleiman lavished on him? The
similar charge made by Iskender Chelebi when at the gallows,
that Ibrahim had been induced by Persian gold to
plan the assassination of the sultan falls to the ground for
the following reasons; lack of any other witness than Isken<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">116</a></span>der<a name="FNanchor_202_202" id="FNanchor_202_202"></a><a href="#Footnote_202_202" class="fnanchor">202</a>
and the discredit that attaches to a witness who was the
vizir’s fiercest and most desperate enemy, together with the
fact that the Persians could offer Ibrahim nothing commensurate
with his wealth and power as grand vizir.</p>

<p>I think then we may definitely put aside the charges of
his being bought with either Persian or Austrian gold.
But the most serious charge remains. Did he aspire to
overthrow his master, and himself become sultan? Again
our sources are silent or ambiguous. Let us inquire of the
Turkish historians. “He fell into the net of the imagination
of kingship and power,”<a name="FNanchor_203_203" id="FNanchor_203_203"></a><a href="#Footnote_203_203" class="fnanchor">203</a> says Osmanzadeh, which
might mean no more than the megalomania of which he
gave so many signs. Sadullah Saïd Effendi expresses himself
with an equal vagueness: “Perhaps Ibrahim was caught
in the net of the thought of partnership of the empire.”<a name="FNanchor_204_204" id="FNanchor_204_204"></a><a href="#Footnote_204_204" class="fnanchor">204</a>
Petchevi makes no charge. Solakzadeh and Abdurrahman
Sheref consider Ibrahim’s death a just punishment for his
treatment of Iskender, but prefer no severe charge.<a name="FNanchor_205_205" id="FNanchor_205_205"></a><a href="#Footnote_205_205" class="fnanchor">205</a> The
Venetians make no accusation beyond the very vague one
that “he loved himself better than he did his lord, and
wished to be alone in the dominion of the world in which
he was much respected.”<a name="FNanchor_206_206" id="FNanchor_206_206"></a><a href="#Footnote_206_206" class="fnanchor">206</a></p>

<p>Guillaume Postel takes up some of the accusations against
Ibrahim and treats them as follows: The accusations were:
1st. Complicity with the defterdar in looting. This Postel
accepts, telling how Ibrahim had looted wherever he had
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">117</a></span>
marched. 2nd. His being a Christian, which we need not
consider further here. 3rd. An understanding with the
Emperor. 4th. An understanding with the Shah of Persia.
5th. A desire to be sultan. 6th. A desire to raise Mustafa,
Suleiman’s son, to the throne. Postel says that Ibrahim certainly
had no understanding with the emperor, as is proved
by the fact that the latter did not use the unexampled opportunity
of the Persian war to invade Turkey, an argument
which seems to us strong. To this he adds the weak argument
that Ibrahim could not bear to hear the emperor
spoken of. The charge of an understanding with the shah
was based on the early losses in the Persian campaign which
Postel disposes of as not being the fault of Ibrahim. The
charge of wishing Mustafa on the throne is baseless and
unreasonable, as the grand vizir could certainly not gain
by a change of masters. As to the charge of wishing to
be sultan, Postel dismisses that with the single argument
that it was a much too dangerous to attempt.</p>

<p>In the absence of any data inculpating Ibrahim of desiring
the throne, we are confined to probabilities. That he
loved power and became very ambitious must be recognized.
Whether he were mad enough to think he could replace
Suleiman on the throne which until this day has never been
held by any other than a member of the family of Othman,
and that he could hold such a position in the face of an enraged
public, Mohammedan to the core as to its army and
priesthood; whether he could have so far lost his judgment
as to conceive that, Christian slave as he was, he could possibly
be in a more advantageous position than the one he
already held by the grace of Suleiman, we cannot answer
except by the fact that in public affairs his brain was still
cool and clear. How far, if at all, he was unfaithful to his
master and friend is buried with him in the convent at
Galata.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">118</a></span></p>

<p>Ibrahim Pasha’s brilliant career was closed. What were
the achievements of his thirteen years of power? He had
carried the Turkish arms to the gates of Vienna in the west
and to Bagdad and Tebriz in the east, and his almost uniformly
successful generalship had added to the great renown
in which the Ottoman army was held. Sometimes
alone, and sometimes under the sultan, he had shown
himself an able strategist, and fearless soldier. He had
established diplomatic relations with Europe, one of his
last acts being the first treaty with the French, and in
diplomacy he had shown himself intelligent, true to Suleiman’s
interests, and strong if not subtle. As an administrator,
his brief power in Egypt was used wisely, and his
governorship of Roumelie was able and strong, if not rising
in a marked degree above the standards of his day. He
was possessed of dignity, impressiveness of manner, and a
magnificence in which he vied with his imperial master.
He certainly had cared for his own interests, obtaining
enormous wealth and power, but that he had ever neglected
his master’s interests is unproved, and many times he
showed himself loyal rather than venal.</p>

<p>Ibrahim’s importance in Turkish history lies partly in
the great diplomatic changes and the conquests which he
achieved together with Suleiman, and partly in the fact
that he was the first grand vizir taken from the people
who exercised much power, and that with him began the
rule of vizirs and favorites which became a very important
fact in later Turkish history. While we recognize the danger
of such rule, yet we also feel that Turkey had a better
chance under such men of ability as Mehmet Sokolli Pasha
and the Kiuprelli vizirs than under the chance sultans of
the Ottoman family, which has produced few great rulers
since Suleiman the Magnificent.</p>

<p>To western students the interest in Ibrahim’s history lies
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">119</a></span>
not only in his bringing Turkey into friendly contact with
Europe, but perhaps more in the very perfect and highly
developed illustration he affords of the curious anomalies,
the romantic possibilities, the strangeness of Turkish rule,
as well as in the light that his career throws on European
rulers and armies of the same century.</p>

Mohammed accepted the institution of slavery, but urged gentleness
in dealing with the slave. Muir thus quotes a speech made by
Mohammed in his last year at Mina: “And your slaves! See that ye
feed them with such food as ye yourselves eat, and clothe them with
the stuffs ye wear. And if they commit a fault which ye are not inclined
to forgive, then sell them, for they are the servants of the Lord,
and not to be tormented.” Muir, <cite>Life of Mahomet</cite>, p. 458.

Teaching of Mohammed</cite> (London, 1873), chap, xv, p. 257. “The
masters were forbidden to exact more work than was just and proper.
They were ordered never to address their male and female slaves
by that degrading appellation, but by the more affectionate name of
‘my young man’ or ‘my young maid’.”</p></div>

We may omit Busbequius’ advocacy of slavery. He continues later:
“The Turks in their way do make a huge advantage of slaves; for
if an ordinary Turk bring home one or two slaves, whom he has taken
as prisoners of war, he accounts he hath made a good campaign of it,
and his prize is worth his labor. An ordinary slave is sold among
them for 40 to 50 crowns, but if he be young and beautiful and have
some skill in some trade also, then they rate him as twice as much.
By this you may know how advantageous the Turkish depredations
are to them, when many times from one expedition they bring home
five or six thousand prisoners.” Ogier Ghiselin de Busbequius, <cite>Travels
in Turkey</cite>, trans. into English, 1774.</p></div>

fallen into the desire for possessions and planned to strike the crown
of Hungary from the hands of the king of Hungary, and finally there
was much fighting among them. After this, with the aid of the king
of Spain, Francis was conquered and several forts being captured, he
fled. Being reduced to an extremity, he was shut up in a solid fortress.
Wishing to have revenge on his enemy, he found no other means than
to betake himself to the Padisha of Islam. He sent an ambassador to
the most blessed Porte with a most humble letter in which was thus
written: ‘If the king of Hungary receives punishment from the blessed
Sultan, we will oppose ourselves to the King of Spain to take revenge.
We beg and pray that the Sultan of the world will repulse that proud
one. After that day we shall be obliged slaves of his Excellency the
Padisha, who is master of time and place and mighty emperor.’ To
this humble prayer and supplication the Sultan, pitying them, in his
merciful glory resolved to make war on this king filled with cruel dispositions,
as we shall see.”</p></div>

the probably legendary tale told by Baudier, which however I will
give. “The Sultanas (Suleiman’s mother and his wife Roxelana) observe
the murmuring of the people against the favorite, and what the
great men speak of him, and tell Suleiman. Moreover as they were
busy to destroy his greatness, they discover that the pasha favored
the house of Austria, and had secret intelligence with the Emperor
Charles V. This treachery being told to Suleiman, he decided upon
Ibrahim’s death, but required a dispensation from his oath never to
disgrace Ibrahim while he lived. One of his learned men gave him
a pleasant Expedit to free himself of the pasha and yet keep his
word. ‘You have sworn, Sire, not to put him to death while you
are living; cause him to be strangled while you are asleep. Life consists
in vigilant action, and he that sleeps doth not truly live; so you
may punish his disloyalty and not violate your oath.’ Suleiman sends
for Ibrahim, and after they have supped he shows him his crimes by
his own letters to Charles V and Ferdinand, reproaches him for his
ingratitude, and commands his mutes to strangle him while he himself
is asleep. He then goes to bed.”
</p>
<p>
The story of the evasion of the oath through the ingenuity of a
“wise man” is plausible, being in entire keeping with Turkish custom,
but Baudier gives no sources, and I have found none of the facts
above stated, in any other record.</p></div>

of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE<br />
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK</h2>

<p>To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.</p>

<h3>Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works</h3>

<p>1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.</p>

<p>1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.</p>

<p>1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.</p>

<p>1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.</p>

<p>1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:</p>

<p>1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:</p>

<blockquote><p>This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United
  States and most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost
  no restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use
  it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with
  this eBook or online
  at <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>. If you
  are not located in the United States, you'll have to check the laws
  of the country where you are located before using this
  ebook.</p></blockquote>

<p>1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.</p>

<p>1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.</p>

<p>1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.</p>

<p>1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.</p>

<p>1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.</p>

<p>1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.</p>

<p>1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that</p>

<ul>
<li>You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."</li>

<li>You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.</li>

<li>You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.</li>

<li>You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.</li>
</ul>

<p>1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing

<h3>Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm</h3>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.</p>

<p>Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org.</p>

<h3>Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation</h3>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.</p>

<p>The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/donate">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.</p>

<p>While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.</p>

<p>International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.</p>

<p>Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate</p>

<h3>Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.</h3>

<p>Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.</p>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.</p>

<p>Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org</p>

<p>This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.</p>
